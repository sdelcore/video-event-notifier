1
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,749
Things are never gonna be the same now.

2
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,963
I mean, look at this.

3
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,674
You got aliens.

4
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,681
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.

5
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,836
When I was a kid,
I used to draw cowboys and Indians.

6
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,972
Actually, it's Native American,
but whatever.

7
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,330
Yeah. Tell you what, though.

8
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:02,919
It ain't bad, is it?

9
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,330
No. Yeah.

10
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,173
Kid's got a future.

11
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,738
Yeah, well...

12
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,736
we'll see, I guess.

13
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,445
No, hey!

14
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,297
You can't saw through that stuff.

15
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:43,196
These alien bastards are tough.

16
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,827
You gotta use the stuff they use.

17
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:48,817
See?
All right.

18
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:49,849
All right.

19
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:52,928
Oh, hey!

20
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,089
Glad you could join us. Afternoon.

21
00:01:56,113 --> 00:01:57,408
Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.

22
00:01:57,432 --> 00:01:58,684
Yeah, yeah, your alarm.

23
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,593
Look, just go stack
that armor plating like I asked you.

24
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,450
This is a huge deal for us.

25
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,081
Attention, please!

26
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,084
In accordance with Executive Order 396B,

27
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,792
all post-battle cleanup operations
are now under our jurisdiction.

28
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,048
Thank you for your service.
We'll take it from here.

29
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,503
Who the hell are you?

30
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,134
Qualified personnel.

31
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,304
Look,

32
00:02:18,413 --> 00:02:21,663
I have a city contract to salvage
all this, Ok, with the city, so...

33
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,118
I apologize Mr. Toomes,

34
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,318
but all salvage operations are
now under our jurisdiction.

35
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,852
Please turn over any and all
exotic materials that you've collected,

36
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,357
or you will be prosecuted.

37
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,776
Ma'am, what am...

38
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,022
Please. Come here.
Hey, lady, come on.

39
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,698
Look...

40
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,646
I bought trucks for this job.

41
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,585
I brought in a whole new crew.

42
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,855
These guys have a family.
I have a family.

43
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,449
I'm all in on this.
I could lose my house.

44
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,760
I'm sorry, sir.
There's nothing I can do.

45
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,246
Maybe next time, don't overextend yourself.

46
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,461
What'd you say?

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
Yeah.

48
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,797
He's right. I overextended myself.

49
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:07,244
Don't do it.
Put them down.

50
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,333
If you have a grievance,
you may take it up with my superiors.

51
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,812
Your superiors.

52
00:03:14,837 --> 00:03:16,426
Who the hell are they?

53
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,355
<i>A joint venture between
Stark Industries and the government,</i>

54
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,946
<i>the Department of Damage Control,
will oversee the collection,</i>

55
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,057
<i>and storage of alien
and other exotic materials.</i>

56
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,218
Now the assholes who made this mess
are paid to clean it up.

57
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,532
Yeah, it's all rigged.

58
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,381
<i>Experts estimate there
are over 1500 tons,</i>

59
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:35,655
<i>of exotic material scattered
throughout the tri-state area.</i>

60
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:36,666
Hey, chief!

61
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,291
We have another load from yesterday.

62
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,068
We're supposed to turn this in, right?

63
00:03:41,238 --> 00:03:42,274
I ain't hauling it.

64
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:43,554
It's too bad.

65
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,537
We could have made some cool stuff
from all that alien junk.

66
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,436
I tell you what.

67
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,480
Let's keep it.

68
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,955
The world's changing.

69
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,003
It's time we change too.

70
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,157
There you go, Mason.

71
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,568
Business is good.

72
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,294
New York. Queens.

73
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,522
<i>It's a rough borough, but, hey, it's home.
Who you talking to?</i>

74
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,254
<i>No one.
Just making a little video of the trip.</i>

75
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,634
<i>You know you can't show it to anyone.</i>

76
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:46,885
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

77
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,421
<i>Then why are you narrating in that voice?</i>

78
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,791
<i>Because it's fun.
Fun?</i>

79
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,861
<i>So, why do they call you Happy?</i>

80
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,407
<i>Come on.
I'm not carrying your bags. Let's go.</i>

81
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:01,988
<i>Hey, should I go to the bathroom before?</i>

82
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,223
<i>There's a bathroom on it.</i>

83
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,379
<i>No pilot? That's awesome.</i>

84
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:07,573
<i>Is that where you're gonna sit?
Yeah.</i>

85
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,035
<i>This is your first time on a private plane?</i>

86
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,948
<i>My first time on any plane.</i>

87
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,365
<i>Should it... Should it be...
Should it be making that noise?</i>

88
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,214
<i>No one has actually told me,</i>

89
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:26,440
<i>why I'm in Berlin,</i>

90
00:06:26,465 --> 00:06:27,688
<i>or what I'm doing.</i>

91
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,222
<i>Something about Captain America going crazy.</i>

92
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,178
<i>This is you.
Oh, we're neighbors?</i>

93
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:35,334
<i>We're not roommates.
Suit up.</i>

94
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,304
<i>Ok, Peter, you got this.
You got this.</i>

95
00:06:37,305 --> 00:06:38,461
<i>What the hell are you wearing?</i>

96
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:40,289
<i>It's my suit.</i>

97
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,145
<i>Where's the case?
What case?</i>

98
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,201
<i>That was... What?
I thought that was a closet.</i>

99
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,411
<i>This is still my room?
Go please.</i>

100
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,275
<i>My room is way bigger than...
Not there.</i>

101
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,156
<i>I found the case. I found the case.
I found the case.</i>

102
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,009
<i>A minor upgrade?</i>

103
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,413
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

104
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,206
<i>Put it on.
What the...</i>

105
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,595
<i>This is the coolest thing I've ever seen...</i>

106
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,661
<i>Let's go. But, yeah.</i>

107
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,025
<i>Well, I don't understand.</i>

108
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,203
<i>Is it for me?</i>

109
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:03,762
<i>Happy. Happy, wait.</i>

110
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,686
<i>This is... This is insane.
Insane.</i>

111
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,877
<i>Look at this thing. Look.
Look at the eyes.</i>

112
00:07:08,954 --> 00:07:09,981
<i>This is the greatest day of my life.</i>

113
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:11,365
<i>Let's go. Come on.
Ok.</i>

114
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,722
<i>Ok, there's Captain America, Iron Man...</i>

115
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:14,545
<i>Black Widow.</i>

116
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,370
<i>Who's that new guy?
Underoos!</i>

117
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:18,107
<i>Oh, that's me.
I gotta go. I gotta go.</i>

118
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,482
<i>Hey, everyone.</i>

119
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:25,054
<i>This is te craziest thing just happened.</i>

120
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:28,192
<i>I just had a fight with Captain America.
I stole his shield. I threw it at him. And...</i>

121
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,152
<i>What the hell? He's big now.
I gotta go. Hang on.</i>

122
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,180
<i>It was. It was the most amazing thing
that's ever happened!</i>

123
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:37,662
<i>Mr. Stark say, hey Underoos!</i>

124
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,832
<i>And I just sort of flipped in,</i>

125
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,470
<i>and stole Cap's shield. I was like,
what's up, everybody? And then...</i>

126
00:07:41,985 --> 00:07:43,152
<i>Hey, just a second!</i>

127
00:07:43,215 --> 00:07:44,215
<i>Coming!</i>

128
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:46,917
<i>Hey?</i>

129
00:07:47,752 --> 00:07:49,153
<i>We have thin walls here.</i>

130
00:07:50,955 --> 00:07:52,589
<i>What are you doing, a video diary?</i>

131
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:54,924
<i>Yeah.
It's all right.</i>

132
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:56,926
<i>I'd do the same thing.
I told him not to do it.</i>

133
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,064
<i>He was filming everything.</i>

134
00:07:58,089 --> 00:07:59,446
<i>I'm gonna wipe the chip.</i>

135
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:00,496
<i>Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.</i>

136
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:02,666
<i>You know we should make an alibi video</i>

137
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,066
<i>for your aunt, anyway are you ready?</i>

138
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:05,803
<i>Alibi?
Yeah, get in the frame.</i>

139
00:08:06,705 --> 00:08:07,937
<i>Hey, May. How you doing?</i>

140
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:09,674
<i>What are you wearing?
Something skimpy, I hope.</i>

141
00:08:11,176 --> 00:08:12,275
<i>Peter, that's inappropriate.</i>

142
00:08:12,277 --> 00:08:13,917
<i>Let's start over.
You can edit it.</i>

143
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:15,412
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

144
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:16,391
<i>Hey, May!</i>

145
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:17,436
<i>My gosh...</i>

146
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:19,581
<i>I wanted to tell you what an...</i>

147
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:21,303
<i>incredible job,</i>

148
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:25,388
<i>your nephew did, this weekend,
at the Stark internship retreat.</i>

149
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,723
<i>Everyone was impressed.</i>

150
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:30,259
<i>Come on!
It's a freaking merge. Sorry.</i>

151
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,928
<i>This because you're not
on Queens Boulevard.</i>

152
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,129
<i>See, Happy is, is,</i>

153
00:08:33,153 --> 00:08:34,997
<i>hoping to get bumped up
to asset management.</i>

154
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:37,567
<i>He was forehead of security,
before that he was a driver.</i>

155
00:08:37,569 --> 00:08:38,968
<i>That a private conversation.</i>

156
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,605
<i>I don't like joking about this.
It was hard for me to talk to you about.</i>

157
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:43,940
<i>No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?</i>

158
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:45,376
<i>Here we are. End of the line.</i>

159
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:49,298
<i>Happy, can you give us a moment?</i>

160
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:50,479
<i>You want me to leave the car?</i>

161
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:52,081
<i>Just grab Peter's case out of the trunk.</i>

162
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:55,218
I can keep the suit?

163
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,888
Yes, we were just talking about it.

164
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,022
Do me a favor, though.

165
00:09:00,324 --> 00:09:02,707
Happy's kind of your point guy,
on this don't stress him out.

166
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:03,860
Don't do anything stupid.

167
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:05,729
I've seen his cardiogram.

168
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,753
All right?
Yes.

169
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,380
Don't do anything I would do,

170
00:09:09,405 --> 00:09:11,214
and don't do anything I wouldn't do.

171
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,695
There's a, there's a little gray area in there.
That's where you operate.

172
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:16,737
Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger?
No.

173
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,241
This it?
Seventh floor.

174
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:21,013
I can take that.
You don't have to.

175
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:21,727
You'll take it?

176
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,395
Yeah, I can take that.
Thank you.

177
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,358
So when's when's our next,
when's our next retreat, you know?

178
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:29,672
What, next mission?

179
00:09:29,797 --> 00:09:31,251
Yeah, the mission.
The missions.

180
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:32,440
We'll call you.

181
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:33,461
Do you have my numbers?

182
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:34,669
No I mean, we'll call you.

183
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:36,765
Like someone will call you.
Ok.

184
00:09:36,768 --> 00:09:37,910
All right.
From your team.

185
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,394
It's not a hug. I'm just
grabbing the door for you.

186
00:09:41,418 --> 00:09:42,821
We're not. We're not there yet.

187
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,308
Bye.

188
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,328
They're gonna call me.

189
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,817
What's up, Penis Parker?

190
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,435
<i>Rise and shine,
Midtown Science and Technology.</i>

191
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,565
<i>Students, don't forget
about your homecoming tickets.</i>

192
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,928
<i>Do you have a date for homecoming?</i>

193
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,046
<i>Thanks Jason, but I already have a date.</i>

194
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,380
<i>Ok.
Yeah.</i>

195
00:11:05,356 --> 00:11:07,740
Damn it.
You, in my office right now.

196
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,469
Hi!

197
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,846
Join me and together,

198
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:32,434
we'll build my new LEGO Death Star.

199
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,358
What?
So lame.

200
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,110
No way. That's awesome.
How many pieces?

201
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,811
Three thousand eight hundred and three.

202
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:40,727
That's insane.
I know!

203
00:11:41,052 --> 00:11:42,524
You want to build it tonight?

204
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:44,238
No, I can't tonight.
I've got the Stark internship.

205
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:46,349
Stark internship.
Yeah, exactly.

206
00:11:46,422 --> 00:11:47,663
Always got that internship.

207
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:50,453
Yeah well, hopefully soon it'll
lead to a real job with them.

208
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,718
That would be so sweet.
Right?

209
00:11:52,742 --> 00:11:54,838
He'd be all, good job on
those spreadsheets, Peter.

210
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,201
Here's a gold coin.

211
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:58,128
I don't know how jobs work.

212
00:11:58,352 --> 00:11:59,652
That's exactly how they work.

213
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:04,022
I'll knock out the basic bones of
the death star at my place and...

214
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,137
And then I'll come by afterwards.

215
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,772
That'd be great.

216
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:20,271
Ok so, how do we calculate linear
acceleration between points A and B?

217
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,471
Flash.

218
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:25,785
It's the product of sine of the
angle and gravity divided by mass.

219
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:27,135
Nope. Peter!

220
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,075
You still with us?

221
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:31,957
Yeah, yeah.

222
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:36,571
Mass cancels out,
so it's just gravity times sine.

223
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,913
Right. See Flash being the fastest
isn't always the best if you are wrong.

224
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,518
You're dead.

225
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:50,430
Today we're talking
about Danish physicist Niels Bohr,

226
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,220
but trust me there's nothing Bohr-ing,

227
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,682
about his discoveries
regarding quantum theory.

228
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,702
Did Liz get a new top?

229
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,809
No. We've seen that before,

230
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:12,739
but never with that skirt.

231
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,412
We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy.

232
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,630
Too late.

233
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,569
You guys are losers.

234
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,043
Well, then why do you sit with us?

235
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,756
Because I don't have any friends.

236
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,761
Let's move to the next question.

237
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,526
What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?

238
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,782
Hydrogen's the lightest.

239
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,213
That's not the question. Ok.

240
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,789
Yeah.
Uranium.

241
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,241
That is correct.
Thank you, Abraham.

242
00:13:40,311 --> 00:13:42,348
Please open your books to page 10.

243
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,330
Peter, it's nationals.

244
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:47,075
Is there no way you could
take one weekend off?

245
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:51,036
I can't go to Washington because if Mr. Stark
needs me then I have to make sure I'm here.

246
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,572
You've never been
in the same room as Tony Stark.

247
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,991
Wait. What's happening?

248
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,725
Peter's not going to Washington.

249
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:57,938
No, no, no, no, no.

250
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:58,862
No. No.

251
00:13:58,863 --> 00:13:59,763
Why not?

252
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,337
Really? Right before nationals?

253
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,315
He already quit marching band
and robotics lab.

254
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,490
I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.

255
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,809
Flash, you're in for Peter.

256
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,400
I don't know.
I gotta check my calendar first.

257
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,685
I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up.

258
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,641
That is false.

259
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,982
What'd I tell you about using the bell
for comedic purposes?

260
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,776
Hey, what's up?
Hey, man.

261
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,874
What's up, Mr. Delmar?

262
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,584
Hey, hey, Mr. Parker.

263
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,965
Number five, right?

264
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,627
Yeah, and with pickles and can you
smush it down real flat? Thanks.

265
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:49,962
You got it, boss.

266
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,667
How's your aunt?

267
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,533
Yeah, she's all right.

268
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,945
She's a very hot Italian woman.

269
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,555
How's your daughter?

270
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,192
Ten dollars.
It's 5 dollars.

271
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,272
For that comment, 10 dollars.
Hey, come on. I'm joking. I'm joking.

272
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,570
Here's 5 dollars.

273
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,618
What's up, Murph?

274
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,366
How you doing, buddy?

275
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:18,520
So, how's school?

276
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,750
You know, it's boring.
Got better things to do.

277
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,907
Stay in school, kid.
Stay in school.

278
00:15:23,008 --> 00:15:24,387
Otherwise you're gonna end up like me.

279
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,827
This is great.

280
00:15:26,152 --> 00:15:27,707
Best sandwiches in Queens.

281
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:38,671
Finally.

282
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:46,082
Could you hold this for a second?

283
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,055
Thanks.

284
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:50,321
Hey, is this anybody's bike?

285
00:16:50,945 --> 00:16:51,945
No?

286
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,507
Hey, hey, buddy is this your bike?

287
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:54,679
I have no change.

288
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,316
Does anyone have a pen?
Do you have a pen?

289
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,335
Everybody good?

290
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:09,672
Hey!

291
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,730
You're that spider guy on YouTube, right?

292
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:13,943
Call me Spider-Man.

293
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,608
Ok, Spider-Man. Do a flip.

294
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,328
Yeah!
Not bad.

295
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,006
Hey, buddy.

296
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,481
Shouldn't steal cars, it's bad.
It's my car, dumb-ass!

297
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,265
Hey! Shut that off!

298
00:17:40,334 --> 00:17:42,071
I was just tried...
Can you tell him it's my car?

299
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,483
I work at nights, come on dude.

300
00:17:44,507 --> 00:17:45,355
That's not your car!

301
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,073
That's his car.
How was I supposed to know his car?

302
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,917
He put that in the window!
Every day with these damn alarms!

303
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:50,393
Shut it off!

304
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:53,128
Don't make me come down there, you punk.

305
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,860
Hey, Gary. How you doing?

306
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,299
Marjorie, how are you?
How's your mother?

307
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,746
I'm good, I'm good.

308
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,373
<i>You have reached the voice-mail box of:</i>

309
00:18:09,747 --> 00:18:11,204
<i>Happy Hogan.</i>

310
00:18:11,228 --> 00:18:13,481
Hey, Happy.
Here's my report for tonight.

311
00:18:13,751 --> 00:18:15,142
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.

312
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,812
Couldn't find the owner,
so I just left a note,

313
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,818
I helped this lost, old Dominican lady.

314
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,360
She was really nice and bought me a churro.

315
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,603
I just feel, like I could be doing more.

316
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,282
You know, just curious
when the next real mission's gonna be.

317
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,039
Cheers, just call me back.

318
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,656
It's Peter. Parker.

319
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,645
Why would I tell him about the churro?

320
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,090
Ok.

321
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:57,787
Can't wait to see this thing.

322
00:18:57,811 --> 00:18:59,411
Finally, something good.

323
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,742
Yo, this high-tech stuff makes it too easy.

324
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,753
Told you it was worth it.
Ok, go, go, go.

325
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,325
Oh, nice.

326
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,841
We can hit like five more places tonight.

327
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,700
What's up, guys?
You forget your PIN number?

328
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,411
You're the Avengers.

329
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,996
What are you guys doing here?

330
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:37,466
Thor. Hulk.

331
00:19:37,491 --> 00:19:38,878
Good to finally meet you guys.

332
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,761
I thought you'd be more
handsome in person.

333
00:19:41,886 --> 00:19:42,446
Iron Man.

334
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:44,711
Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank?
You're a billionaire.

335
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,348
Hey...

336
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,514
<i>This feels so weird.</i>

337
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,108
What is that thing?

338
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,422
I'm starting, to think,
you're not, the Avengers.

339
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,735
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

340
00:20:06,313 --> 00:20:10,599
Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers
in a bank on 21st Street.

341
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,600
All right guys, let's wrap this up.
It's a school night.

342
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,841
So how do jerks like you get tech like this?

343
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,503
No. Wait!

344
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,733
Mr. Delmar.

345
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,054
Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here?

346
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:33,871
Is anybody in here? Hello?

347
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,962
Come on.

348
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:47,704
I gotta...

349
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:49,947
Here, here.

350
00:20:50,272 --> 00:20:51,096
Good, yeah.

351
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,371
Ok. Good. Yes.

352
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,211
Yes. No. No, put that down.

353
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,820
That's worth more than you or me.

354
00:20:58,841 --> 00:20:59,239
Yeah?

355
00:20:59,364 --> 00:21:01,309
Happy, the craziest thing
just happened to me.

356
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,476
These guys were robbing an ATM
with high-tech weapons...

357
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:04,501
Hey. Hey. Take a breath, Ok.

358
00:21:04,502 --> 00:21:07,156
I don't have time for ATM robberies,
<i>Yeah, but...</i>

359
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:10,400
or the thoughtful notes you leave behind.
I have moving day to worry about.

360
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,185
<i>Everything's gotta be out by next week.</i>

361
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,497
Wait. Wait. You're moving?
Who's moving?

362
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:15,997
Yeah, don't you watch the news?

363
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,816
Tony sold Avengers Tower.

364
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:20,482
We're relocating to a new facility
upstate where hopefully,

365
00:21:20,607 --> 00:21:21,828
the cell service is much worse.

366
00:21:21,852 --> 00:21:22,969
But what about me?

367
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,335
What about you?

368
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,188
What if Mr. Stark needs me
or something I don't know,

369
00:21:27,213 --> 00:21:28,313
something big goes down?

370
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,121
<i>Can I please talk to Mr. Stark?</i>

371
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,696
Just stay away
from anything too dangerous.

372
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,011
I'm responsible for making

373
00:21:33,036 --> 00:21:34,540
<i>sure you're responsible, Ok?</i>

374
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:37,771
I am responsible. I...

375
00:21:38,096 --> 00:43:17,859
Oh, crap.

376
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,461
<i>My backpack's gone.</i>
That doesn't sound responsible.

377
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:42,781
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

378
00:21:43,106 --> 00:21:44,152
Feel free not to.

379
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,071
What was that?

380
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,916
That's nothing! Nothing!

381
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,800
You're the Spider-Man.

382
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,521
From YouTube.

383
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:53,928
I'm not. I'm not.

384
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,288
You were on the ceiling.

385
00:22:55,313 --> 00:22:56,933
No, I wasn't.
Ned, what are you doing in my room?

386
00:22:56,934 --> 00:22:58,846
Aunt May let me in. You said we
were gonna finish the Death Star!

387
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,227
You can't just bust into my room!

388
00:23:01,227 --> 00:23:04,196
That turkey meat loaf
recipe is a disaster.

389
00:23:04,321 --> 00:23:05,460
Let's go to dinner.

390
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,500
Thai, Ned?

391
00:23:06,525 --> 00:23:08,448
You want Thai?
No. He's got a thing.

392
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:10,272
A thing to do, after.

393
00:23:11,482 --> 00:23:12,482
Ok.

394
00:23:14,022 --> 00:23:15,322
Maybe put on some clothes.

395
00:23:17,442 --> 00:23:19,332
She doesn't know?
Nobody knows.

396
00:23:19,952 --> 00:23:22,052
Only Mr. Stark knows, 'cause he
made my suit, but that's it.

397
00:23:22,272 --> 00:23:23,772
Tony Stark made you that?

398
00:23:24,242 --> 00:23:25,542
Are you an Avenger?

399
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:28,132
Yeah. Basically.

400
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,352
You can't tell anybody about this.
You gotta keep it a secret.

401
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:34,851
A secret, why?
If sheknow, if she finds out,

402
00:23:34,852 --> 00:23:37,432
people try and kill me every single night,
she's not gonna let me do this anymore.

403
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:38,817
Come on Ned. Please.

404
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,492
Ok. Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok.

405
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:42,330
I'll level with you.

406
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:44,009
I don't think I can keep this a secret.

407
00:23:44,034 --> 00:23:45,367
This is the greatest thing that's
ever happened to me, Peter!

408
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:48,099
Ned. May cannot know.
I cannot do that to her right now.

409
00:23:48,624 --> 00:23:49,510
You know.

410
00:23:49,735 --> 00:23:51,292
With everything that's happened with her, I...

411
00:23:51,537 --> 00:23:52,534
Please...

412
00:23:54,937 --> 00:23:55,937
Ok.

413
00:23:56,195 --> 00:23:57,490
Just swear it. Ok?

414
00:23:58,171 --> 00:23:59,209
I swear.

415
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,388
Thank you.

416
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,194
I can't believe this is happening right now.

417
00:24:03,585 --> 00:24:04,645
Can I try the suit on?
No.

418
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:05,696
How's it work? Is it magnets?

419
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:06,721
How do you shoot the strings?

420
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,054
I'm gonna tell you about
this at school tomorrow. Ok?

421
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:09,078
Great.

422
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,512
Ok. Wait then...

423
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:13,955
How do you do this,
and the Stark internship?

424
00:24:16,115 --> 00:24:17,509
This is the Stark internship.

425
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,834
Just get out.

426
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,569
What's the matter?

427
00:24:26,094 --> 00:24:27,702
I thought you loved larb.

428
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,588
It's too larby?

429
00:24:30,313 --> 00:24:32,038
Not larby enough.

430
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,424
How many times do I have
to say larb before...

431
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:37,514
you talk to me?

432
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,220
You know I larb you.

433
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:43,030
I'm just stressed.
The internship, and I'm tired.

434
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,240
A lot of work.

435
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,060
The Stark internship?

436
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,209
I have to tell you,

437
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:50,584
not a fan of that Tony Stark.

438
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,233
Distracted all the time...

439
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,004
He's got you in your head.

440
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,810
<i>The beloved Queens institution</i>

441
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,030
<i>Delmar's Sandwiches,</i>
What does he have you doing?

442
00:24:58,054 --> 00:24:59,620
<i>Was destroyed in an explosion</i>
You need to use your instincts.

443
00:24:59,644 --> 00:25:03,339
<i>Early tonight after an ATM robbery was
thwarted by Queens' own</i>

444
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,430
<i>colorful, local,</i>
What?

445
00:25:04,454 --> 00:25:05,940
<i>Crime-stopper, the Spider-Man.</i>

446
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,909
<i>As the Spider-Man attempted
to foil their heist</i>

447
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,534
<i>a powerful blast was set off,</i>

448
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,804
<i>slicing through the
bodega across the street.</i>

449
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,890
<i>Miraculously, no one was harmed.</i>

450
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,882
If you spot something like that happening,

451
00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:18,450
you turn and you run the other way.

452
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,860
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

453
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,420
Six blocks away from us.

454
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,390
I need a new backpack.

455
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,625
What?

456
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,344
I. I need a new backpack.

457
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,790
That's five.

458
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,988
Sticky rice pudding.

459
00:25:32,213 --> 00:25:33,464
We didn't order that.

460
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,040
It's on the house.

461
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,480
Thanks.

462
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,730
That's nice of him.

463
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,570
I think he larbs you.

464
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,310
You got bit by a spider?

465
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,940
Can it bite me?

466
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,640
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?

467
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,400
You know what, whatever. Even if it did hurt,
I'd let it bite me.

468
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
May... Maybe.

469
00:25:54,684 --> 00:25:56,730
How much did it hurt?
The spider's dead, Ned.

470
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,670
You were here?

471
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,690
Yeah.

472
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,290
You could've died.

473
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,880
Do you lay eggs?

474
00:26:17,404 --> 00:26:18,840
What?
No.

475
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,860
Can you spit venom?

476
00:26:23,585 --> 00:26:24,284
No.

477
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,120
Can you summon an army of spiders?

478
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,980
No, Ned.

479
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,920
How far can you shoot your webs?

480
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,040
It's unknown. Shut up.

481
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,579
If I was you,

482
00:26:37,603 --> 00:26:39,179
I would stand on
the edge of a building and just

483
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,760
and just shoot it as far as I could...
Shut up, Ned.

484
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,480
<i>Hi. I'm Captain America.</i>

485
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:46,295
<i>Whether you're in the classroom,</i>

486
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,626
<i>or on the battlefield.</i>
Do you know him too?

487
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,670
Yeah, we met.

488
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,930
I stole his shield.

489
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,830
<i>Today, my good friend,</i>

490
00:26:53,354 --> 00:26:54,599
<i>your gym teacher,</i>

491
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,220
<i>will be conducting the Captain America
Fitness Challenge.</i>

492
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,380
Thank you, Captain.

493
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,490
I'm pretty sure this guy's
a war criminal now

494
00:27:00,514 --> 00:27:01,749
but whatever,
I have to show these videos,

495
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,570
It's required by the state.
Let's do it.

496
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,670
Do Avengers have to pay taxes?

497
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,180
What does Hulk smell like?

498
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,710
I bet he smells nice.
You have to shut up.

499
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,848
Is Captain America cool?

500
00:27:11,273 --> 00:27:12,704
Or is he like a mean old grandpa?

501
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,760
Ned, just shhh, ok?

502
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,053
Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?

503
00:27:17,478 --> 00:27:18,355
What?

504
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,957
Yeah. You know how there's a guy,

505
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:21,264
with a headset,

506
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,050
telling the other guy where to go?

507
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,323
Like. Like if you're stuck
in an apartment building,

508
00:27:25,448 --> 00:27:26,450
I could tell you where to go.

509
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,690
Because there'd be screens around me,
and I could swivel around them,

510
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,096
because I could be your guy in the chair.

511
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,984
Ned, I don't need a guy in the chair.

512
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,390
Looking good, Parker.

513
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,920
Now see for me, it would be...

514
00:27:38,345 --> 00:27:39,484
F Thor,

515
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,600
marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.

516
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,310
Well, what about the Spider-Man?

517
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,890
It's just Spider-Man.

518
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,036
Did you see the bank
security cam on YouTube?

519
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:48,294
He fought off four guys.

520
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,370
Oh, my God,
she's crushing on Spider-Man.

521
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,520
No way.

522
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,730
Kind of.
Oh, gross.

523
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,950
He's probably 30.
You don't know what he looks like.

524
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,940
Like, what if he's seriously burned?

525
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,920
I wouldn't care. I'd love him
for the person he is inside.

526
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,860
Peter knows Spider-Man.

527
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,820
No, I don't. No. I... I mean...

528
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,330
They're friends.

529
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,760
Yeah, like Coach Wilson
and Captain America are friends.

530
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,590
I've met him, yeah.

531
00:28:16,691 --> 00:28:17,764
A couple times.

532
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,880
But it's...

533
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,620
through the Stark internship.

534
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,350
Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed
to talk about it.

535
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,174
Well, that's awesome. Hey?

536
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:29,830
You know what, maybe you should
invite him to Liz's party. Right?

537
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,632
Yeah, I. I'm having people over tonight.

538
00:28:32,857 --> 00:28:34,214
You're more than welcome to come.

539
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,218
Having a party?

540
00:28:35,343 --> 00:28:36,480
Yeah, it's gonna be dope.

541
00:28:36,504 --> 00:28:38,570
You should totally invite your
personal friend Spider-Man.

542
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,940
It's Ok.

543
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,030
I know Peter's way too busy
for parties anyway, so...

544
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,030
Come on. He'll be there.
Right, Parker?

545
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,870
What are you doing?

546
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,330
Helping you out.

547
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,290
Did you not hear her?

548
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,220
Liz has a crush on you.

549
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,420
Dude, you're an Avenger.

550
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,460
If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.

551
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,470
House party in the suburbs.

552
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,920
I remember these.

553
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:18,210
Kind of jealous.

554
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,600
It'll be a night to remember.

555
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,630
Ned, some hats wear men.
You wear that hat.

556
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,310
Yeah, it gives me confidence.

557
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,990
This is a mistake.

558
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,500
Hey, let's just go home.

559
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,030
Oh, Peter.

560
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:32,950
I know. I know it's really hard,

561
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,370
trying to fit in with all the changes
your body's going through.

562
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,880
It's flowering now.

563
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,930
He's so stressed out lately.

564
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,690
What helps with stress, is going to a party.

565
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,086
We should go to the party.
Let's do it.

566
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,110
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

567
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,210
Peter.

568
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,200
Have fun, Ok?
I will.

569
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Bye May.

570
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,030
Dude, you have the suit, right?

571
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,340
This is gonna change our lives.

572
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,660
Ok. We're gonna have Spider-Man swing in.

573
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:18,999
Say you guys are tight,

574
00:30:19,324 --> 00:30:21,890
and I get a fist bump for one of
those half bro bumps.

575
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,870
Can't believe you guys
are at this lame party.

576
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,250
But you're here too.

577
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,460
Am I?

578
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,460
Oh, my gosh.

579
00:30:31,885 --> 00:30:32,785
Hey, guys.

580
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,034
Cool hat, Ned.

581
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,630
Hi, Liz.
Hi, Liz.

582
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,680
I'm so happy you guys came.

583
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,450
There's pizza and events.
Help yourself.

584
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,520
What a great party.
Thanks.

585
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,570
I... My parents will kill me if
anything's broken. I gotta...

586
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,430
Yeah.

587
00:30:51,631 --> 00:30:52,631
Have fun.

588
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,660
Bye.
Bye.

589
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,290
Dude, what are you doing?

590
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,150
She's here. Spider it up.

591
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,956
No, no, no, no.

592
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:01,655
I can't. I cannot do this.

593
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,650
Spider-Man is not a party trick, Ok?

594
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,255
Look, I'm just gonna...

595
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,114
be myself.

596
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,260
Peter, no one wants that.

597
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,620
Dude.

598
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:14,510
Penis Parker, what's up?

599
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,510
So where's your pal Spider-Man?

600
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,220
Let me guess: In Canada
with your imaginary girlfriend?

601
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,130
That's not Spider-Man.

602
00:31:22,355 --> 00:31:24,154
That's just Ned in a red shirt.

603
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,470
Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man.

604
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,680
Just thought I'd swing by
and say hello to my boy Peter.

605
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,220
Oh, what's up, Ned?
Hey, where's Peter, anyways?

606
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,380
He must be around...

607
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,017
God, this is stupid.

608
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:49,564
What am I doing?

609
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,760
What the hell?

610
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,330
This sucks.

611
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:31,880
Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed
sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.

612
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,340
Here. You try.

613
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,951
Man, I wanted something low-key, like...

614
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:38,624
Why are you trying to outsell me, man?

615
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,660
Ok, Ok, Ok.
I got what you need, all right?

616
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,413
I got tons of great stuff here.

617
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:44,038
One sec.

618
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,060
Ok.

619
00:32:45,403 --> 00:32:46,241
I got...

620
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,878
black-hole grenades, Chitauri railguns.

621
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,050
You letting off shots in public now?
Hurry up.

622
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,613
Look, times are changing.

623
00:32:52,614 --> 00:32:54,894
We're the only ones selling
these high-tech weapons.

624
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,200
This must be where
the ATM robbers got their stuff.

625
00:32:58,224 --> 00:32:59,972
I need something to stick up somebody.

626
00:32:59,996 --> 00:33:01,019
I'm... I'm not trying...

627
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:02,888
to shoot them back in time.

628
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,920
I got antigrav climbers.

629
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,310
Yo, climbers?

630
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,170
Ok, what the hell is that?

631
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,340
Did you set us up?
Hey, hey, man.

632
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,880
Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot
at somebody, shoot at me.

633
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,840
All right.

634
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,810
What was that?

635
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,960
Oh, no, no!

636
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,820
We gotta call him.

637
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,920
Did you just do it again?

638
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,111
Shut up.

639
00:33:59,236 --> 00:34:00,544
I'm calling him.

640
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,280
Toomes' phone.

641
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,310
Boss.

642
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,240
Oh, my butt!

643
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,873
Great.

644
00:34:36,098 --> 00:34:37,535
Guess I'm gonna have to take a shortcut.

645
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,100
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.

646
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,420
Hey, hey, buddy.

647
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,780
Sorry, no time to play.
Here, go fetch.

648
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:51,060
Now, this is more like it.

649
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,330
Smells really good.

650
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,200
Great movie!

651
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,610
Oh, hey girls.

652
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,540
No! No!

653
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,610
<i>Hey, it's Peter. Leave a message.</i>

654
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,790
Peter, where are you?

655
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,020
The hat's not working.
This is not cool.

656
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,240
Almost got you.

657
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,740
Thought you got away from me,
didn't you?

658
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,270
I got you, right where I want you.

659
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,020
Surprise!

660
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,220
What the hell?

661
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,341
And then he just like swooped down.

662
00:36:50,566 --> 00:36:52,074
Like a monster he picked me up...

663
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:55,164
up and took me over like 1000
feet and just dropped me

664
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,140
How'd you find me? Did you put
a tracker on my suit or something?

665
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,850
<i>I put everything in your suit.</i>

666
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,650
<i>Including this heater.</i>

667
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,500
That's better. Thanks.

668
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,650
<i>What were you thinking?</i>

669
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,166
The guy with the wings is obviously
the source of the weapons.

670
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,320
I gotta take him down.

671
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,850
<i>Take him down now?</i>

672
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,910
<i>Steady, Crockett. There are people
who handle this sort of thing.</i>

673
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,990
The Avengers?

674
00:37:18,115 --> 00:37:20,044
<i>No, no, no. This is a little
below their paygrade.</i>

675
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,104
Anyway, Mr. Stark.

676
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:23,349
You didn't have to come all the way
out here. I had that.

677
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,170
I was fine.

678
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,309
<i>Oh, I'm not...</i>

679
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:26,584
<i>here.</i>

680
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,389
Thank God this place has Wi-Fi,

681
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,030
or you would be toast right now.

682
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,518
Thank Ganesh while you're at it.

683
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,185
Cheers.

684
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,390
<i>Look, forget the flying vulture guy,
please.</i>

685
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,700
Why?
<i>Why?</i>

686
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,210
Because I said so!

687
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,080
Sorry, I'm talking to a teenager.

688
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,610
<i>Stay close to the ground.</i>

689
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,771
<i>Build up your game helping little people,</i>

690
00:37:47,896 --> 00:37:49,944
like that lady that bought you the churro.

691
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,564
<i>Can't you just be...</i>

692
00:37:51,889 --> 00:37:52,889
friendly...

693
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,360
neighborhood Spider-Man?

694
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,450
But I'm ready for more than that now.

695
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,790
<i>No, you're not.</i>

696
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,270
That's not what you thought
when I took on Captain America.

697
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,068
<i>Trust me, kid.</i>

698
00:38:02,293 --> 00:38:04,165
<i>If Cap wanted to lay
you out, he would've.</i>

699
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,880
<i>Listen to me. If you come across
these weapons again, call Happy.</i>

700
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,390
Are you driving?

701
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,460
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about college.

702
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,680
I got some pull at MIT. End call.

703
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,560
No, I don't need to go to...

704
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,570
<i>Mr. Stark is no longer connected.</i>

705
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,620
That's awesome.

706
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,910
Stay close to the ground?
What is he talking about?

707
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,230
Hey, what's up?
I'm on my way back.

708
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,520
Actually, I was calling to say
maybe you shouldn't come. Listen.

709
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,890
When I say penis, you say Parker.

710
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:59,050
Penis!
Parker!

711
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,440
Penis!
Parker!

712
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:03,050
<i>Sorry, Peter. I guess we're still losers.</i>

713
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,280
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>
I'll see you tomorrow in school.

714
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,310
Idiots.

715
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,850
Idiots.

716
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,140
Idiots!

717
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520
Boss?

718
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,964
Your wife keeps texting you.

719
00:39:56,265 --> 00:39:57,424
Something about a brake light.

720
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,380
What'd I tell you about
looking at my phone?

721
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,200
Sorry. You left it out.

722
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,210
You know I'm a curious person by nature.

723
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,950
I finished designing
that high-altitude vacuum seal.

724
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,300
In case you wanna, you know,
go for the big one?

725
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,834
You're still on that?

726
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:15,079
I told you, no.

727
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,530
The answer's no. Forget it.

728
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,870
Ok, that was badass.

729
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,012
How many times have I told you,

730
00:40:35,237 --> 00:40:37,194
not to fire them out in the open?

731
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,962
Hey you said, move the merchandise.

732
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:40,004
Under the radar.

733
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,160
Under the radar!

734
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,870
That's how we survive.

735
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,981
If you bring Damage Control,

736
00:40:44,982 --> 00:40:47,004
or the Avengers down here, we're through.

737
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,170
You're out there wearing that goofy thing,
lighting up cars...

738
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:51,999
Calling yourself The Shocker.

739
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,915
I'm the Shocker. I shock people.

740
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,354
What is this, pro wrestling?

741
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,990
Whatever, old man. Come on.

742
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,570
Look.

743
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,130
Look.

744
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,590
I know you don't give a crap
about anything.

745
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,780
But I do.

746
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,639
I built this whole place because
I got people I have to look after.

747
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

748
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,130
You know what?

749
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,560
I can't afford your bullshit.

750
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,090
Get out of here.
What?

751
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,650
You're done. You're off the crew.

752
00:41:23,075 --> 00:41:24,174
Yeah, all right.

753
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,370
All right.

754
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,860
Wonder if you can afford me
out there, though, right?

755
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,460
With everything I know.

756
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:32,860
Excuse me?

757
00:41:33,885 --> 00:41:34,984
I'm just saying...

758
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,960
maybe your wife would like to know
where you really get your money from.

759
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,550
You know what?

760
00:41:40,655 --> 00:41:41,194
What?

761
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,550
You're right.

762
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,550
That work?
I don't know.

763
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,980
I can't afford that.

764
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,520
Damn.

765
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:02,490
I thought this was the antigravity gun.

766
00:42:02,614 --> 00:42:03,249
What?

767
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,440
No, that's that one.

768
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,760
Here.

769
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,372
Now you're the Shocker.

770
00:42:21,597 --> 00:42:23,344
Go out there and find
that weapon he lost.

771
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,140
All right.

772
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,160
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.

773
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,890
Yeah, well, something came up.

774
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:39,860
What is that?

775
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,820
I don't know.
Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.

776
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,350
Seriously?
Yeah.

777
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:45,680
Awesome.

778
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,808
I mean, not awesome.

779
00:42:48,509 --> 00:42:50,390
Totally uncool of that guy.
So scary.

780
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,990
Well, look, I think it's...

781
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,920
a power source.

782
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,770
Yeah, but it's connected
to all these microprocessors.

783
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,297
That's an inductive charging plate.

784
00:43:00,322 --> 00:43:01,774
That's what I use to charge
my toothbrush.

785
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:05,260
Whoever's making these weapons is
obviously combining the alien tech with ours.

786
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,400
That is literally the coolest sentence
anyone has ever said.

787
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:10,691
I just want to thank you,

788
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:12,444
for letting me be part of your journey,

789
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,460
into this amazing...

790
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,690
Keep your fingers clear of the blades.

791
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,940
I gotta figure out what this is
and who makes it.

792
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:27,430
We'll go to the lab after
class and run some tests.

793
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:28,580
Let's do it.

794
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,940
First, I say we put the glowy thing
in the mass spectrometer.

795
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,280
First, we gotta come up with
a better name than glowy thingy.

796
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,330
You're right.

797
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,920
Crap.

798
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,690
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

799
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,350
High schools creep me out.

800
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,020
It's got this funny smell,
you know what I mean?

801
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,180
Hey, that's one of the guys
that tried to kill me.

802
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
What?

803
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,350
Yeah.
We gotta get out of here.

804
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,700
No, no, no, no, no.

805
00:44:02,924 --> 00:44:05,760
I gotta follow them. They can lead me
to the guy that dropped me in the lake.

806
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,370
Someone dropped you in a lake?
Yeah, it was not good.

807
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:11,890
Peter...
No. Stay there, Ned.

808
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,160
Peter.

809
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,840
What are you doing?

810
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,200
Nothing.

811
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,290
Yeah. You good?

812
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,010
Chess.

813
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,690
Can you imagine what the boss
would say if he knew where we were?

814
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,840
It's saying there was
an energy pulse here.

815
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,270
There's no sign of the weapon.

816
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:35,220
And even if it was here, now it's gone.

817
00:44:35,645 --> 00:44:36,674
So are we.

818
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,890
This is so awesome.

819
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:13,190
I know, right?

820
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,590
They're in Brooklyn.

821
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,430
Staten Island.

822
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,260
Leaving Jersey.

823
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,370
They stopped.

824
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,720
Maryland?

825
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,930
What's there?
I don't know.

826
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:49,340
Evil lair?

827
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,783
Evil lair?

828
00:45:50,807 --> 00:45:53,915
Dude, a gang with alien guns run by
a guy with wings, yeah, they have a lair.

829
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,770
Badass.

830
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,410
But how are you gonna get there
if it's, like, 300 miles away?

831
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,560
It's not too far from D.C.

832
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,960
Hey, it's Peter.
Guys.

833
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:06,730
Peter?
Hey, buddy.

834
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,840
Yeah, I was hoping maybe
I could rejoin the team.

835
00:46:08,864 --> 00:46:09,910
No, no way.

836
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:13,400
You can't quit on us stroll up
and be welcomed back by everyone.

837
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,650
Hey, welcome back Peter!

838
00:46:15,075 --> 00:46:16,674
Flash, you're back to first alternate.

839
00:46:16,698 --> 00:46:18,060
What?
He's taking your place.

840
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,436
Excuse me, can we go?

841
00:46:19,437 --> 00:46:21,449
Already 'cause I was hoping
to get in some light protesting

842
00:46:21,474 --> 00:46:23,484
in front of one of the embassies
before dinner, so...

843
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,090
Protesting is patriotic.
Let's get on the bus.

844
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,640
Focus up, everyone. Our next
topic is the moons of Saturn.

845
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,820
The second law of thermodynamics.

846
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:34,990
Frank Sinatra.

847
00:46:35,214 --> 00:46:36,214
Fort Sumter.

848
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:37,392
Flash is wrong.

849
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:38,914
Ok guys, let's focus. Next one.

850
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:40,300
Liz, don't overwork them.

851
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:42,710
Strontium, barium, vibranium.

852
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:43,564
Very good, Peter.

853
00:46:43,889 --> 00:46:45,704
Glad to have you back.
Glad to be back.

854
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,469
What is the current standard unit of...
Can I take this real quick?

855
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:51,580
Yeah, fine.

856
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:52,605
Hello?

857
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:55,150
Got a blip on my screen here.
You left New York?

858
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:56,850
Ok, focus up, everyone.
Tracker.

859
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:58,460
Yeah, no it's just a school trip.

860
00:46:58,484 --> 00:46:59,399
It's... It's nothing.

861
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,105
Look Happy,

862
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:03,580
I gotta say, you tracking me without my
permission is a complete violation of my privacy.

863
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:05,182
That's different.

864
00:47:05,207 --> 00:47:06,114
What's different?

865
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,820
Nothing. Look, it's just
the Academic Decathlon.

866
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,242
<i>It's no big deal.</i>
Hey, hey.

867
00:47:10,267 --> 00:47:11,994
I'll decide if it's no big deal.

868
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,720
Sounds like no big deal,
but remember, I'm watching you.

869
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,990
Everyone stick together.
Yeah.

870
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,079
You kidding me?

871
00:47:32,204 --> 00:47:33,154
This place is huge.

872
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:34,238
I've seen bigger.

873
00:47:34,563 --> 00:47:35,904
There's a bird in here.

874
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,685
Hey, you brought your laptop, right?

875
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:39,324
Why?

876
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,320
Peter...

877
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:50,990
why are we removing
the tracker from your suit?

878
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,370
Because I gotta follow these guys
to their boss before they move and...

879
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:59,050
and I don't really want Mr. Stark
to know about it.

880
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,719
So you're lying to Iron Man now?

881
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,050
No, I'm not lying.

882
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,340
He just doesn't really get what I can do yet.

883
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:11,730
Gotcha.

884
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,370
All right Happy, enjoy tracking this lamp.

885
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,850
There's a ton of other subsystems in here,

886
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:26,380
but they're all disabled
by the Training Wheels Protocol.

887
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,740
What?

888
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:29,557
Training Wheels Protocol?

889
00:48:30,182 --> 00:48:31,384
Turn it off.

890
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,650
I don't think that's a good idea, I mean,
they're blocked for a reason.

891
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,200
Come on, man,
I don't need training wheels.

892
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,840
I'm sick of him treating me
like a kid all the time.

893
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:40,957
It's not cool.

894
00:48:40,982 --> 00:48:42,334
But you are a kid.

895
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:44,560
Yeah. A kid who can stop
a bus with his bare hands.

896
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,147
Peter, I just don't think
this is a great idea. I mean...

897
00:48:47,372 --> 00:48:48,504
what if this is illegal?

898
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,528
Look, please.

899
00:48:49,653 --> 00:48:51,634
This is my chance to prove myself.

900
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:53,520
I can handle it. Ned, come on.

901
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:56,510
I really don't think this is a good idea.
The guy in the chair.

902
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,630
Don't do that.
Come on.

903
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,220
The glowy thing, it's evidence.
Keep it safe.

904
00:49:15,225 --> 00:49:16,615
All right?
Ok. Ok.

905
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:19,970
They're moving.
Be careful.

906
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,730
Hey, Liz.
Perfect timing.

907
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,260
We're gonna go swimming.

908
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:29,350
Come on, come on, come on.
What?

909
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,520
Hey, Peter.
Hi.

910
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:34,190
Hey.

911
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:36,944
I was... I was gonna go study...

912
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:39,014
in the business center.

913
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,630
Peter, you don't need to study.
You're like the smartest guy I've ever met.

914
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,250
And besides...

915
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:46,910
A rebellious group activity the day
before competition is good for morale.

916
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,560
Well, I read that in a TED Talk, so...

917
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,970
I... I heard it in a TED Talk.

918
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,360
And I read a coaching book.

919
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,140
Are you really, this
is really important to you?

920
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,070
Yeah. It's our future.

921
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,760
I'm not gonna screw it up.

922
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,580
Besides, we raided the minibar
and these candy bars were, like, $11.

923
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,700
So get your trunks on and come on.
Come on.

924
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,290
Come on.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

925
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,610
Let's go.

926
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,750
<i>Good evening, Peter.</i>
Hello? Hello?

927
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,840
<i>Congratulations on completing
the Training Wheels Protocol...</i>

928
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,550
<i>and gaining access
to your suit's full capabilities.</i>

929
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,010
Thank you.

930
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:49,310
<i>So where would you like to take me tonight?</i>

931
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,190
I put a tracker on someone.
He's a bad guy.

932
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:53,700
<i>Tracker located.</i>

933
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:57,000
<i>Plotting course to intercept target.</i>

934
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:00,160
Ok well, as long as I make it
back in time for decathlon, it's fine.

935
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,680
<i>One hundred meters
from destination and closing.</i>

936
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:12,480
<i>Jump now.</i>

937
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,280
<i>Detecting three individuals.</i>

938
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:23,960
Why is their secret lair in a gas station?
That's so lame.

939
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:29,660
Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?

940
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:31,320
<i>Do you want to hear what they're saying?</i>

941
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,810
I can hear what they're saying?
Yeah.

942
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,900
<i>Activating Enhanced
Reconnaissance Mode.</i>

943
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:39,020
<i>I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup.
but the rest is my design.</i>

944
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,480
That's so cool.

945
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:42,658
<i>Can't believe they're still
cleaning up that Triskelion mess.</i>

946
00:51:42,783 --> 00:51:43,461
<i>I love it.</i>

947
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,980
<i>They keep making messes,
we keep getting rich.</i>

948
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,240
<i>Target inbound.</i>

949
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,230
They're in the middle of a heist.

950
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:51,230
I can catch them all red-handed.
This is awesome!

951
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:53,930
Ok, I'm gonna get a little closer
so I can see what's happening.

952
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:56,670
<i>Would you like me to engage
Enhanced Combat Mode?</i>

953
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,870
Enhanced Combat Mode?
Yeah.

954
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:00,800
<i>Activating Instant Kill.</i>

955
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,150
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't want to kill anybody.

956
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:05,110
<i>Deactivating Instant Kill.</i>

957
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:10,220
Did you hear that?

958
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,740
What the hell just happened?
What was that?

959
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,830
<i>You jumped off the sign
and landed on your face.</i>

960
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:19,130
Suit lady, what's wrong
with my web shooters?

961
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:21,570
<i>Rapid-fire is the default
for Enhanced Combat Mode.</i>

962
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:23,002
Why would I need rapid-fire?

963
00:52:23,027 --> 00:52:24,474
<i>Would you like to see more options?</i>

964
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:27,810
<i>You have 576 possible
web-shooter combinations.</i>

965
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,590
Mr. Stark really overdid it.

966
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:30,830
You two wait right here.

967
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,220
Wait. You're gonna want
to turn on the dampers.

968
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,980
That thing will shatter your arm.

969
00:52:35,005 --> 00:52:36,604
All right, where's the dampers?

970
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,360
That one.
<i>Great choice.</i>

971
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:40,810
<i>Would you like me to set this
as your new default?</i>

972
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:43,550
No, no, no.

973
00:52:43,574 --> 00:52:44,574
Push that in.
Here?

974
00:52:44,598 --> 00:52:45,898
No, the other.
This one here?

975
00:52:45,922 --> 00:52:46,629
Yeah.

976
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,743
What was that?

977
00:52:47,868 --> 00:52:48,994
<i>Taser webs.</i>

978
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:50,970
Taser webs?
I don't want Taser webs.

979
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,940
<i>You seem to be unfamiliar
with your web-shooter settings.</i>

980
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,950
<i>Would you like to run a refresher course?</i>

981
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:58,260
No. Just... You choose.
<i>Sure thing.</i>

982
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,990
<i>Six-alpha-niner, are you running on time?</i>

983
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:04,720
Copy, central.
Six-alpha-niner on schedule.

984
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,560
I got a visual.
Green light, green light.

985
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:15,270
That's him.

986
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,170
<i>Ok. I got eyes on the convoy.</i>

987
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:22,750
<i>Pulling in behind the caboose.</i>

988
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,940
<i>Deploy anchors.</i>

989
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:37,530
<i>Dropping down.</i>

990
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:42,230
No outgoing distress signals.
You're clear.

991
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:46,790
<i>Hey. Looks like they got
some good stuff here.</i>

992
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,790
Cool. It's like some kind of
matter phase shifter.

993
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,040
<i>All right, coming up.</i>

994
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:13,000
Hey, Big Bird.
This doesn't belong to you.

995
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,390
Oh, God.

996
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,210
Suit lady, what was that?
<i>You told me to choose.</i>

997
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:28,540
What? No, just set everything
back to normal.

998
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,860
<i>Activating all systems.</i>

999
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,800
My head.

1000
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,040
<i>You appear to have a mild concussion.</i>

1001
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,740
Hey, so where am I right now?

1002
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,430
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

1003
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:01,140
<i>The container walls are hindering
my sensors.</i>

1004
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:03,890
Wait a minute.

1005
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:07,100
They must have hijacked the truck
and taken me to their evil lair.

1006
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,120
Ok, suit lady, we're gonna
have to fight our way out of this one.

1007
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:14,240
Three, two, one.

1008
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:21,900
What is this place?

1009
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,910
Suit lady, where am I?

1010
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,000
<i>You're in the most secure facility
on the Eastern Seaboard.</i>

1011
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,760
<i>The Damage Control deep-storage vault.</i>

1012
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,140
No. Seriously?

1013
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,660
<i>The door will most likely
remain closed until morning.</i>

1014
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:38,220
Morning?

1015
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:43,180
Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad
calling you suit lady, you know?

1016
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,840
I think I should probably give you a name.

1017
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,340
Like Liz. No, no, no.

1018
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,300
God, that's... That's weird.

1019
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:52,450
What about Karen?

1020
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:55,540
<i>You can call me Karen if you would like.</i>

1021
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:57,900
Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?

1022
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,780
What?

1023
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:02,570
Maybe we should run that refresher course.

1024
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,630
<i>Ricochet web.</i>
Ricochet web.

1025
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:08,260
Cool.
<i>Splitter web.</i>

1026
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:11,490
<i>Web grenade.</i>
Web grenade!

1027
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,420
Should I tell Liz that I'm Spider-Man?

1028
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,970
<i>Who is Liz?</i>

1029
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,860
Who's Liz? She's...

1030
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:22,390
She's the best. She's awesome.

1031
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:24,670
She's just a girl who goes to my school.

1032
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:26,480
And...

1033
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,058
Yeah, I just. I really want to tell her, but,

1034
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:30,594
it's kind of weird, you know?

1035
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:33,850
Hey, I... I'm Spider-Man.

1036
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,230
<i>What's weird about that?</i>

1037
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,450
What if she's expecting
someone like Tony Stark?

1038
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:39,710
Imagine how disappointed
she'd be when she sees me.

1039
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,430
<i>Well, if I were her,
I wouldn't be disappointed at all.</i>

1040
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:44,790
Thanks, Karen.

1041
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,410
It's really nice to have somebody to talk to.

1042
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,820
Hey, how long we been here anyways?

1043
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,860
<i>Thirty-seven minutes.</i>
What?

1044
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,940
Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.

1045
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,280
I cannot take this anymore.
I got to... I gotta get out of here.

1046
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,730
There's got to be something in here
I can use.

1047
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:04,520
Ok, let's see.

1048
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:06,430
Nope.

1049
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,310
That's awesome.

1050
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,420
Hey, it's like the glowy thing.

1051
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,170
<i>That glowy thing is
an explosive Chitauri energy core.</i>

1052
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:17,730
You mean, we've been
carrying around a bomb?

1053
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:21,220
<i>It would require radiation
to transform it into an explosive state.</i>

1054
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:24,050
No, no, no.

1055
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:31,110
Hey! Please!
Please, somebody let me out! Hey!

1056
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:33,470
Karen, you have to help me override
that time lock.

1057
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,040
Ok, Karen, lower the voltage and run it.

1058
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:37,710
<i>Trial unsuccessful.</i>

1059
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,640
Ok, we're just gonna have
to try every sequence.

1060
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:45,560
Ned, Peter, we're gonna be late.
Come on, let's go.

1061
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,950
Ok. Hold on, hold on.

1062
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,210
<i>Initiating trial 247.</i>

1063
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:57,520
It worked. It works.

1064
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:13,590
<i>Please be sure
all cell phones are turned off.</i>

1065
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:14,750
Thank you.

1066
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,980
Karen, get me to
decathlon as fast as possible.

1067
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,270
<i>Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.</i>

1068
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:20,060
Across the street
from the Washington Monument.

1069
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:21,230
<i>It's Ned. Leave a message.</i>

1070
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,100
Ned! Call me back.
The glowy thing's a bomb!

1071
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,460
<i>There's a vehicle approaching on your right.</i>

1072
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:33,440
<i>We have now entered sudden death.</i>

1073
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,400
<i>The next correct answer wins
the championship.</i>

1074
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:42,160
<i>Midtown Tech?</i>

1075
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:43,850
Zero.

1076
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:45,660
<i>That is correct.</i>

1077
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:48,700
<i>Midtown takes the championship.</i>

1078
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,510
We won!
Guys, I'm so proud of you!

1079
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:53,824
Told you we didn't need Peter.

1080
00:58:53,848 --> 00:58:55,764
Flash, you didn't answer a question.

1081
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:57,133
Taking it all in, Michelle?

1082
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:58,581
Yeah, I just...

1083
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,230
I don't really wanna celebrate something
that was built by slaves.

1084
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,910
I'm sure the Washington Monument
wasn't built by...

1085
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:08,260
Ok.

1086
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,049
Enjoy your book.

1087
00:59:10,174 --> 00:59:11,154
Thanks.

1088
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,685
Ned, you're alive.

1089
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:16,004
Peter, are you Ok?

1090
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:17,940
Ned, Ned, where's the glowy thing?
The glowy thing?

1091
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,531
Don't worry. It's safe.
It's in my backpack.

1092
00:59:19,532 --> 00:59:20,456
No, Ned! Listen!

1093
00:59:20,481 --> 00:59:21,814
No, Ned! The glowy thing is dangerous!

1094
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:23,370
You missed the decathlon.
I covered for you.

1095
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,204
Ned, listen to me!

1096
00:59:24,205 --> 00:59:25,544
We're in the Washington Monument.
How're you gonna...

1097
00:59:25,568 --> 00:59:27,129
Peter, is that you?
Hey, Liz.

1098
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,809
<i>Is that Liz?</i>
Put Ned back on the phone.

1099
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:30,222
<i>You should tell her how you feel.</i>

1100
00:59:30,223 --> 00:59:31,764
You flake. You are lucky we won.

1101
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:33,937
You know, I wanna be mad,
but I'm real worried.

1102
00:59:33,961 --> 00:59:35,523
But what is going on with you?

1103
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,180
Liz, I have to talk to Ned,
it's really important!

1104
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:38,530
Miss, all items on the belt, please.

1105
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:39,810
<i>There's something in Ned's backpack.</i>

1106
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,840
<i>It's dangerous.
Don't let it go through an x-ray.</i>

1107
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,845
Liz? Liz!

1108
00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:46,970
Damn it.

1109
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:52,730
Hey Mr. Harrington, can I be the one
to tell Peter he's expelled?

1110
00:59:56,930 --> 01:00:02,690
The Washington Monument is 555 feet,
five and one-eighth inches tall.

1111
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,450
Notice how the marble and granite
are cut around the stone.

1112
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:16,399
No, no, no, no, no.

1113
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,614
Karen, what's going on up there?

1114
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:19,890
<i>The Chitauri core has detonated</i>

1115
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,100
<i>and caused severe structural damage
to the elevator.</i>

1116
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:23,480
Oh, no.
My friends are up there.

1117
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,138
What?

1118
01:00:24,563 --> 01:00:25,975
Don't worry, ma'am,
everything's gonna be Ok.

1119
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:27,472
Excuse me, excuse me!

1120
01:00:27,573 --> 01:00:28,734
Oh my God, that's tall!

1121
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:35,890
Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling.

1122
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:37,360
Just stay calm everyone.

1123
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,400
We are all going to die here.

1124
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,690
<i>Estimating 10 minutes
before catastrophic failure.</i>

1125
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,060
We're freaking screwed.

1126
01:00:46,084 --> 01:00:47,816
Ok guys, I know that looks scary,

1127
01:00:47,841 --> 01:00:49,674
but our safety systems are working.

1128
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,240
<i>The safety systems
are completely failing.</i>

1129
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:54,080
We're very safe in here.

1130
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,740
<i>The occupants are
in imminent mortal danger.</i>

1131
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:58,090
Going as fast as I can!

1132
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,440
Let's go.
Give me your hand.

1133
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:13,509
<i>You now have 125 seconds
until catastrophic failure.</i>

1134
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:14,510
What? Why?

1135
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:17,560
<i>Unexpected motion has caused
the deterioration to escalate.</i>

1136
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:18,983
How do I get in there?

1137
01:01:19,007 --> 01:01:20,914
<i>Activating reconnaissance drone.</i>

1138
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:25,198
Has that been there this whole time?

1139
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,164
That's awesome.

1140
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,650
<i>Locating optimal entry point.</i>

1141
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,030
<i>Proceed to southwest window.</i>

1142
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,150
Karen, I'm on my way.

1143
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:40,530
There's a lot of glass here.
You got this.

1144
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:41,880
Keep coming, keep coming.

1145
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:57,930
Ok. Oh, my God.

1146
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,770
Ok.

1147
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,620
<i>What's wrong? You've reached
the southwest window.</i>

1148
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:05,500
<i>Why are you hesitating?</i>
It's fine.

1149
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,280
I've just never been this high before.

1150
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,710
<i>You have also not reinstalled
your parachute,</i>

1151
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:12,490
<i>so a fall from this height
would most likely be lethal.</i>

1152
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:15,380
Perfect.

1153
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:16,830
Oh, my God.

1154
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:19,990
Why is it not breaking?

1155
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,140
<i>It's four-inch ballistic glass.
You'll have to create more momentum.</i>

1156
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,400
<i>This is D.C. Metro Police.
Identify yourself.</i>

1157
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,150
My friends are in there! Stop!

1158
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:49,060
<i>Return to the ground immediately.</i>

1159
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:51,230
Ok, who's next?
Me, it's my turn.

1160
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,140
Flash, seriously? What are you doing?

1161
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,770
Come on.
Don't worry about the trophy.

1162
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:05,000
<i>Stand down!</i>

1163
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,520
<i>Return to the ground immediately.</i>

1164
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:14,090
<i>Return to the ground
or we will open fire!</i>

1165
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,600
Go up, go up.

1166
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:18,200
I got this.

1167
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:19,840
Take my trophy.

1168
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:23,790
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

1169
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:25,700
I'm gonna die.

1170
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,530
Look out!

1171
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,300
Break!

1172
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:51,370
I did it.

1173
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,950
Hey, how you doing?
Don't worry. I got you.

1174
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,007
Yes!

1175
01:04:09,332 --> 01:04:10,889
Yes.
Hey, hey, hey.

1176
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:12,980
Big guy, quit moving around.
I'm sorry, sir! So sorry.

1177
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,450
Let's go, let's go!

1178
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:24,370
Ok, Ok.

1179
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:26,500
Mr. Harrington, go.
Ned, come on.

1180
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,460
All right. This is your stop.
Come on, Liz.

1181
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,149
Go, go, go. Everybody out.

1182
01:04:30,474 --> 01:04:31,674
Move it, people.
Move it, move it.

1183
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:33,370
Are you sure it's safe?
Liz.

1184
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:34,940
Liz!

1185
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:41,220
You're Ok. You're Ok.

1186
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:45,720
Ok.

1187
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,940
Oh, my God.
Good, good.

1188
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,680
Come on up.
Come on, you guys, stay back.

1189
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:54,110
So is everyone Ok?

1190
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:56,950
<i>This is your chance, Peter.</i>

1191
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,460
<i>Kiss her.</i>

1192
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:03,980
Thank you.

1193
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:09,930
Are you really friends with Peter Parker?

1194
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:18,842
I can finish the next order,

1195
01:05:18,967 --> 01:05:20,894
but without any new materials
from that truck...

1196
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:24,020
Yeah, damn it.

1197
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:27,460
We still have enough to do
the Gargan deal though, right?

1198
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,900
Yeah, but then that's it.

1199
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:36,020
Maybe it is time
that I built the high-altitude seal.

1200
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,810
Would you shut up about that?
It's only one job.

1201
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:38,930
No.

1202
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:41,853
Eight years,

1203
01:05:42,078 --> 01:05:44,315
not a word from the feds,
nothing from those.

1204
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:47,610
Halloween-costume-wearing bozos
up there in Stark Tower.

1205
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:49,956
And then all of a sudden,

1206
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:52,814
this little bastard in
red tights shows up.

1207
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:56,220
And he thinks he can tear down
everything I've built.

1208
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,470
Really?

1209
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:02,300
I'm gonna kill him.

1210
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:04,510
I'm gonna find him.
I found him.

1211
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,110
<i>The Spider-Man swooped in,</i>

1212
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:09,460
<i>heroically saving an Academic
Decathlon team from Queens.</i>

1213
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,440
<i>The identity of the masked hero
is still unknown.</i>

1214
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:16,940
Mom.
Oh, kids. All right.

1215
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:20,110
Peter. Come here,
come here, come here.

1216
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:26,530
<i>This past weekend,
Midtown's Academic Decathlon team,</i>

1217
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,670
<i>defeated the country's best
to win the national championship.</i>

1218
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:31,500
<i>Later that day,
they also defeated death.</i>

1219
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:34,080
<i>Explosion. Sally scream.
Flash scream. Everybody screaming.</i>

1220
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:38,050
<i>There were purple lasers and smoke.
It was **** tight, like a Bon Jovi concert.</i>

1221
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:41,190
<i>As you know, we made it out alive,
and that's the important thing.</i>

1222
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:44,050
<i>I couldn't bear to lose
a student on a school trip.</i>

1223
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:47,140
<i>Not again.</i>

1224
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:51,330
<i>Thankfully, no one was seriously injured
thanks to the Spider-Man.</i>

1225
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,560
<i>Thank you, Spider-Man.
Thank you, Spider-Man.</i>

1226
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,720
<i>Up next: the Spider-Man mania
is sweeping the school.</i>

1227
01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:59,110
<i>How can you show your spider spirit?</i>

1228
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:05,160
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

1229
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,140
What is it like being famous
when nobody knows it's you?

1230
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,670
Crazy, dude.
It's crazy.

1231
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,108
Should we tell everyone?

1232
01:07:11,233 --> 01:07:11,695
No.

1233
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:12,940
Should I tell everyone?

1234
01:07:13,165 --> 01:07:14,654
No, dude. That's not a good idea.

1235
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,630
Ok. Well, we're gonna go to class.
I'm not going to class.

1236
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:20,309
You're already in so much trouble
for ditching the decathlon.

1237
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:21,760
Dude listen, I figured it out, right.

1238
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,209
The wingsuit guy is stealing
from Damage Control.

1239
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:25,632
And what he takes from Damage Control,

1240
01:07:26,057 --> 01:07:27,310
that's how he builds the weapons.

1241
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:28,912
So all I gotta do is catch him.

1242
01:07:28,937 --> 01:07:30,200
But we have a Spanish quiz.

1243
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:32,280
Ned, I'm probably never gonna
come back here.

1244
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,290
Mr. Stark is moving the Avengers upstate so...

1245
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:37,420
when I bring this guy in...

1246
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:39,900
Dude. You want to be a high school dropout?

1247
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:42,740
I am so far beyond high school right now.

1248
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,920
Parker, my office.

1249
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,510
<i>So...</i>

1250
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:51,380
<i>you got detention.</i>

1251
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:53,910
<i>You screwed up.
You know what you did was wrong.</i>

1252
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,460
<i>The question is,
how are you gonna make things right?</i>

1253
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:57,940
<i>Maybe you were trying to be cool.</i>

1254
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,170
<i>But take it from a guy
who's been frozen for 65 years,</i>

1255
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:03,163
<i>the only way to really be cool,</i>

1256
01:08:03,188 --> 01:08:04,584
<i>is to follow the rules.</i>

1257
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:08,090
<i>We all know what's right.
We all know what's wrong.</i>

1258
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:11,561
<i>Next time those turkeys try to convince
you of something you know is wrong...</i>

1259
01:08:11,686 --> 01:08:12,495
Where you going?

1260
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:13,354
Get back here.

1261
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,670
<i>What would Captain America do?</i>

1262
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:17,830
Why are you here?
You don't have detention.

1263
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:19,287
Oh I know, I just like,

1264
01:08:19,312 --> 01:08:21,514
coming here to sketch people in crisis.

1265
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:25,840
It's you.

1266
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:28,134
<i>So your body's changing.</i>

1267
01:08:28,259 --> 01:08:30,314
<i>Believe me, I know how that feels.</i>

1268
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,360
May?

1269
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:48,300
Hey, Karen. What's up?

1270
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:50,460
<i>Hey Peter.
How was your Spanish quiz?</i>

1271
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:51,750
Listen, I was wondering
if you could help me.

1272
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,300
I'm trying to figure out who the guys
under the bridge were that night but

1273
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:56,810
I mean I can only kinda remember
part of the license plate.

1274
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:59,770
<i>I can run facial recognition on
the footage of that encounter.</i>

1275
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:01,440
Footage?
<i>Yes, Peter.</i>

1276
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,380
<i>I record everything you see.</i>

1277
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:04,770
Everything?
<i>Everything.</i>

1278
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:05,525
All the time?

1279
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:07,304
<i>It's called the Baby Monitor Protocol.</i>

1280
01:09:08,070 --> 01:09:09,390
Yeah, of course it is.

1281
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,389
Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.

1282
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:14,164
<i>With pleasure.</i>

1283
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,320
<i>Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party.</i>

1284
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,840
<i>Hey, what's up, Liz?
Peter's told me a lot about you.</i>

1285
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,960
No, no, no. No, no, no.
This is just me messing around.

1286
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:22,840
Go later in the day, later in the day.

1287
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,439
<i>It is I, Thor, son of Odin.</i>

1288
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:26,900
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's definitely...

1289
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,690
No that's definitely not
what we wanted to watch.

1290
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:30,620
Just...
<i>Your impressions are verry funny.</i>

1291
01:09:30,644 --> 01:09:32,079
Fast-forward to the arms deal.

1292
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:33,380
Ok.

1293
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,270
The two on the right, who are they?

1294
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,660
<i>Searching law-enforcement databases.</i>

1295
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:40,420
<i>No records found
for two of the individuals.</i>

1296
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:42,590
Nothing?
<i>One individual identified.</i>

1297
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,770
<i>Aaron Davis, age 33.</i>

1298
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:47,580
<i>He has a criminal record
and an address here in Queens.</i>

1299
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:49,190
Let's pay him a visit.

1300
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:52,300
<i>Would you like me to activate
the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?</i>

1301
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,350
Yeah.

1302
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:10,070
Remember me?

1303
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:13,030
I need information.
You'll give it to me now.

1304
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:14,610
All right, chill.
Come on!

1305
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:16,817
What happened to your voice?

1306
01:10:16,841 --> 01:10:18,204
What do you mean,
what happened to your voice?

1307
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:20,570
I heard you by the bridge.
I know what a girl sound like.

1308
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,004
I'm not a girl. I'm a boy.

1309
01:10:22,029 --> 01:10:23,694
I mean, I'm a... I'm a man.

1310
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:25,570
I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl...

1311
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:27,400
I'm not a girl. I'm a man.

1312
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,910
Come on, man.
Look, who is selling these weapons?

1313
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:32,370
I need to know. Give me names or else.

1314
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:37,498
You ain't ever done this before?

1315
01:10:38,023 --> 01:10:39,954
Deactivate Interrogation Mode.

1316
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:42,780
Look, man.

1317
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:46,230
These guys are selling weapons
that are crazy dangerous.

1318
01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:47,710
They can't be out on the streets.

1319
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,150
Look if one of them can cut
Delmar's Bodega in half...

1320
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:51,146
You know Delmar's?

1321
01:10:51,371 --> 01:10:52,734
Yeah. The best sandwich in Queens.

1322
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:54,218
Sub Haven's pretty good.

1323
01:10:54,243 --> 01:10:55,304
It's too much bread.

1324
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:56,109
I like bread.

1325
01:10:56,134 --> 01:10:57,494
Come on man, please.

1326
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,520
Stupid Interrogation Mode.
Karen, don't ever do that again.

1327
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:05,850
The other night, you told that dude,
if you shoot somebody, shoot me.

1328
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:07,780
It's pretty ballsy.

1329
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:09,690
I don't want those weapons
in this neighborhood.

1330
01:11:09,714 --> 01:11:11,230
I got a nephew who live here.

1331
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:14,090
Who are these guys?

1332
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:16,110
What can you tell me
about the guy with the wings?

1333
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:18,760
Other than he's a psychopath
dressed like a demon, nothing.

1334
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:20,620
I don't know who he is or where he is.

1335
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:25,103
I do know where he's gonna be.

1336
01:11:26,228 --> 01:11:27,115
Really?

1337
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:29,900
Yes, this crazy dude
I used to work with he's...

1338
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:32,190
supposed to be doing a deal with him.

1339
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:33,780
Yes! Yes.

1340
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:35,140
Thank...
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1341
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,800
I didn't tell you where.
You don't have a location.

1342
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,360
Right, of course.
Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just...

1343
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:41,980
Yeah.

1344
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:43,285
Where is it?

1345
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:44,644
Can I give you some advice?

1346
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:47,630
You gotta get better at this part of the job.

1347
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:49,160
I don't understand.

1348
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,700
I'm intimidating.

1349
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:53,740
Staten Island Ferry, 11.
Oh, that's soon.

1350
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:55,830
That's gonna dissolve in two hours.

1351
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:58,580
No, no, no. Come fix this.

1352
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:00,550
Two hours. You deserve that.
I got ice cream in here.

1353
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:01,888
You deserve that.
You're a criminal.

1354
01:12:01,912 --> 01:12:03,194
Bye, Mr. Criminal.

1355
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,900
Nice.

1356
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:23,045
Ok, Karen,

1357
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:25,334
activate Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.

1358
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,480
<i>Sure thing.</i>

1359
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,630
<i>He's up front, main deck.</i>

1360
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:30,320
<i>I hate this guy.</i>

1361
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,820
It's the guy from the bridge, right?
Who's that other guy?

1362
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:34,610
Just keep me posted.

1363
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:36,790
<i>There's no record of him
in my criminal database.</i>

1364
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:39,630
<i>Incoming call from May Parker. Should
I reroute to your heads-up display?</i>

1365
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:41,080
I can't talk right now. I'll call her back.

1366
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:46,830
Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy.
We can't let anybody get away this time.

1367
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:57,680
Who's the guy on the left?
<i>Mac Gargan.</i>

1368
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,260
<i>Extensive criminal record,
including homicide.</i>

1369
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,270
<i>Would you like me
to activate Instant Kill?</i>

1370
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:05,050
No, Karen, stop it
with the Instant Kill already.

1371
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:09,350
White pickup truck.

1372
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:15,990
Dronie, scan the ship
for a white pickup truck.

1373
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,130
Oh, this is too perfect.

1374
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:40,640
I got the weapons, buyers
and sellers in one place.

1375
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,772
<i>Incoming call from Tony Stark.</i>

1376
01:13:42,897 --> 01:13:43,794
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1377
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:45,312
Don't answer.
<i>Mr. Parker.</i>

1378
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:46,248
<i>Got a sec?</i>

1379
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:48,390
I'm actually at school.
<i>No, you're not.</i>

1380
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:50,730
<i>Nice work in D. C.</i>
Ok.

1381
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:53,810
<i>My dad never really gave me
a lot of support,</i>

1382
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:56,040
<i>and I'm trying to break
the cycle of chain...</i>

1383
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:57,420
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now..

1384
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,960
<i>Don't cut me off
when I'm complimenting you.</i>

1385
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,510
<i>Anyway, great things are about
to happen...</i>

1386
01:14:01,534 --> 01:14:02,534
<i>What is that?</i>

1387
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:04,764
I'm at band practice.

1388
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:08,813
<i>That's odd. Happy told me you
quit band six weeks ago.</i>

1389
01:14:09,038 --> 01:14:09,738
<i>What's up?</i>

1390
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:11,360
I gotta go. End call.
<i>Hey.</i>

1391
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,150
I'll take those!

1392
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:15,120
Yoink.

1393
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,535
Hey, guys. The illegal-weapons-deal
ferry was at 10:30.

1394
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,444
You missed it.

1395
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:30,550
<i>Spider guy's here.</i>

1396
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,320
Not so fast.

1397
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:38,058
Are you guys Ok?

1398
01:14:38,059 --> 01:14:39,274
My bad. That was a little hard.

1399
01:14:40,690 --> 01:14:42,970
I gotta say, the other guy was
way better with that thing.

1400
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,320
I'm honestly...

1401
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,700
I'm... I'm shocked.

1402
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:01,680
Freeze! FBI.
Don't move.

1403
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:03,440
Get on the ground.
FBI.

1404
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,050
What do you mean, FBI?

1405
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:07,688
<i>The FBI is the Federal Bureau of Investigation...</i>
I know what the FBI means,

1406
01:15:07,689 --> 01:15:08,754
but what are they doing here?

1407
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:17,890
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way!

1408
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:20,990
No.

1409
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:24,790
Look out, look out, look out.
Move, move, move!

1410
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,520
Move.
Get to the top deck.

1411
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:33,910
We're getting out of here.

1412
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,780
Activate Taser web!

1413
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,950
You're messing with things
you don't understand.

1414
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,610
Oh, my God. What do I do?

1415
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:13,730
Karen give me an x-ray of the boat
and target all the strongest points.

1416
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:18,710
Web grenade. Web grenade.

1417
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:22,660
Splitter web, go.

1418
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:54,650
<i>Great job, Peter.
You are 98 percent successful.</i>

1419
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,170
Ninety-eight?
Yeah, Spider-Man!

1420
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:01,030
No, no, no.

1421
01:18:01,054 --> 01:18:02,054
No!

1422
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:21,290
No!

1423
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:37,970
What the hell?

1424
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:42,670
What the hell?

1425
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,780
<i>Hi, Spider-Man.</i>

1426
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:48,920
<i>Band practice, was it?</i>

1427
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,380
Yeah, Iron Man!

1428
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:21,860
Mr. Stark.

1429
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:26,560
Hey, Mr. Stark, could I do anything?
What do you want me to do?

1430
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:30,300
<i>I think you've done enough.</i>

1431
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:45,714
So that's it.

1432
01:19:46,039 --> 01:19:47,314
You're just gonna run?

1433
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:52,040
Feds were waiting for us.

1434
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,770
Now we're on Iron Man's radar?

1435
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:57,390
Yeah, I'm running.

1436
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,850
You should too.

1437
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:02,130
You know I can't do that.

1438
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:03,610
So now what?

1439
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:05,093
Mason?

1440
01:20:05,418 --> 01:20:08,865
Can you get that high-altitude
seal thing up and running in time?

1441
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:10,800
Seriously?

1442
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:11,830
Yes.

1443
01:20:12,455 --> 01:20:13,564
You will not regret this.

1444
01:20:16,690 --> 01:20:17,800
You in?

1445
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:32,800
<i>Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch
I tell you to stay away from this.</i>

1446
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:36,149
<i>Instead, you hacked a multimillion-dollar suit,</i>

1447
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:39,394
<i>so you could sneak around behind
my back doing the one thing,</i>

1448
01:20:39,419 --> 01:20:41,073
<i>I told you not to do.</i>

1449
01:20:41,399 --> 01:20:42,504
Is everyone Ok?

1450
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:44,960
<i>No thanks to you.</i>

1451
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:47,750
No thanks to me?

1452
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:53,870
Those weapons were out there and I tried
to tell you about it but you didn't listen.

1453
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:57,260
None of this would've happened
if you had just listened to me.

1454
01:20:57,820 --> 01:20:59,870
If you even cared, you'd actually be here.

1455
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:05,486
I did listen, kid.

1456
01:21:05,711 --> 01:21:07,324
Who do you think called the FBI?

1457
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:10,609
Do you know I was the only
one who believed in you?

1458
01:21:10,610 --> 01:21:14,210
Everyone else said I was crazy
to recruit a 14-year-old kid.

1459
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:14,953
I'm 15.

1460
01:21:14,978 --> 01:21:16,695
No, this is where you zip it, all right?

1461
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:17,794
The adult is talking.

1462
01:21:18,119 --> 01:21:19,354
What if somebody had died tonight?

1463
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:21,690
Different story, right?
Because that's on you.

1464
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,090
And if you died...

1465
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:25,760
I feel like that's on me.

1466
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:28,910
I don't need that on my conscience.
Yes, sir.

1467
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:30,113
Yes.
I'm sorry.

1468
01:21:30,113 --> 01:21:31,885
Sorry doesn't cut it.
I'm sorry. I understand.

1469
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:34,110
I just. I just wanted to be like you.

1470
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:35,820
And I wanted you to be better.

1471
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:39,940
Ok. It's not working out.
I'm gonna need the suit back.

1472
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:41,130
For how long?

1473
01:21:41,454 --> 01:21:42,589
Forever.

1474
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:44,640
Yeah, that's how it works.
No, no, no, no. Please. Please.

1475
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,929
Let's have it.
Please, you don't understand,

1476
01:21:45,953 --> 01:21:46,979
this is all I have.

1477
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:48,160
I'm nothing without this suit.

1478
01:21:48,910 --> 01:21:51,430
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.

1479
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,500
Ok?

1480
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:54,250
God, I sound like my dad.

1481
01:21:57,090 --> 01:21:58,760
I don't have any other clothes.

1482
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:00,830
Ok, we'll sort that out.

1483
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:12,810
Hey.

1484
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:19,628
I've been calling you all day.

1485
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:21,254
You didn't answer your phone.

1486
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:22,850
You can't do that.

1487
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:24,940
Then this ferry thing happens.

1488
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:28,680
I've called five police stations.

1489
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:29,760
Five.

1490
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,198
I called five of your friends.

1491
01:22:31,223 --> 01:22:32,379
I called Ned's mother.
I'm fine.

1492
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:33,380
May, I'm Ok.

1493
01:22:33,404 --> 01:22:34,735
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.

1494
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:37,670
Cut the bullshit.

1495
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,410
I know you left detention.

1496
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:41,870
I know you left the hotel room
in Washington.

1497
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:44,260
I know you sneak out
of this house every night.

1498
01:22:44,530 --> 01:22:45,720
That's not fine.

1499
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:48,198
Peter, you have to tell
me what's going on.

1500
01:22:48,223 --> 01:22:49,234
Just lay it out.

1501
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:50,730
It's just me and you.

1502
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,930
I lost the Stark internship.

1503
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:55,810
What?
Yeah.

1504
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:57,980
What happened?

1505
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:02,220
I just thought that I could work really
hard and he could... He would... You know.

1506
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:03,344
But...

1507
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:05,210
I screwed it up.

1508
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:07,770
It's Ok, it's Ok.

1509
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:10,800
It's Ok.

1510
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,800
I'm sorry I made you worry.

1511
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:16,510
You know I'm not trying to ruin your life.

1512
01:23:16,670 --> 01:23:17,860
Yeah, I know.

1513
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:19,130
Just...

1514
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:21,160
I used to sneak out too.

1515
01:23:21,584 --> 01:23:22,284
Yeah.

1516
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:27,340
And take a shower. You... smell.

1517
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,880
You smell like garbage.

1518
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:31,350
I know.

1519
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:37,719
Peter, you're a good kid
and you're a smart kid so,

1520
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:39,550
just try to keep your head straight, Ok?

1521
01:23:40,570 --> 01:23:41,570
Ok.

1522
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,640
All right, get out of here.

1523
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:53,240
Are you expelled?

1524
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:56,410
Do you have to go to that high school
where the principal has a crossbow?

1525
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:59,230
Pretty sure that's an urban myth,
and no I'm not expelled.

1526
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:01,960
You're so lucky.

1527
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:51,880
Hey.

1528
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:53,213
Hey.

1529
01:24:53,238 --> 01:24:54,025
I...

1530
01:24:54,149 --> 01:24:55,708
thought you had calculus fifth period.

1531
01:24:55,820 --> 01:24:57,900
Yeah, I was just doing
some homecoming stuff.

1532
01:24:58,270 --> 01:24:59,490
Hey look I...

1533
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:03,670
I. I just wanted to apologize
about the whole decathlon thing.

1534
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:04,820
It's fine.
It's really...

1535
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:07,892
Last week decathlon was
the most important thing, but...

1536
01:25:08,017 --> 01:25:09,054
I almost died.

1537
01:25:09,390 --> 01:25:10,420
No, I'm. I...

1538
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,580
I just mean that...

1539
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:15,430
it was not cool, especially...

1540
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,230
because...

1541
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,380
I like you.

1542
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:25,270
I know.

1543
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:29,340
You do?

1544
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:32,140
You're terrible at keeping secrets.

1545
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:33,970
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

1546
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:39,250
I got. I got to get to class but...

1547
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:43,480
I'd say we should hang out,
but I'm gonna be in detention for...

1548
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:46,400
ever but...

1549
01:25:47,570 --> 01:25:50,010
I guess you already have a date
to homecoming.

1550
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:53,790
Actually, I was so busy planning it,
I never really got around to that part, so...

1551
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:57,710
Do you want to...

1552
01:25:57,870 --> 01:25:58,920
go with me?

1553
01:25:59,870 --> 01:26:01,710
Yeah. Sure.

1554
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:02,628
Really?

1555
01:26:02,853 --> 01:26:04,425
I mean, great. Cool.

1556
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:05,880
Cool.

1557
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:09,090
I'm actually going that way.

1558
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:22,440
May, I need your help.

1559
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:40,710
Through or around?

1560
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:46,710
Right?

1561
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,560
It's game day. So, what's the plan?

1562
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:00,770
Open the door for her.

1563
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:04,069
Tell her she looks nice, but not
too much because that's creepy.

1564
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,310
Don't be creepy.
No.

1565
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:06,038
And...

1566
01:27:06,163 --> 01:27:08,065
When I dance with her,
I'm putting my hands on her hips.

1567
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:09,260
I got this.

1568
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:13,320
Love you.
Bye.

1569
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:29,640
You must be Peter.

1570
01:27:30,670 --> 01:27:31,700
Yeah.

1571
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,410
I'm Liz's dad.

1572
01:27:33,670 --> 01:27:35,170
Put her there.

1573
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,300
Hell of a grip.

1574
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:38,970
Come on in here. Come on.

1575
01:28:03,290 --> 01:28:04,540
Hi, Peter.

1576
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,800
You look very handsome.

1577
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,160
Thank you.

1578
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:10,150
You got his name right?

1579
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,659
Freddie?
Peter.

1580
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:13,780
Peter. Peter.

1581
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:15,900
I'm gonna go get Liz.

1582
01:28:16,210 --> 01:28:17,210
Ok.

1583
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:24,940
You all right, Pete?

1584
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:26,100
Yeah.

1585
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,780
Because you look pale.

1586
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:32,280
You want something to drink like a...

1587
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,765
Bourbon or a Scotch,
or something like that?

1588
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:36,160
I'm not old enough to drink.

1589
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:38,120
That's the right answer.

1590
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:45,140
Do you look beautiful.
Please don't embarrass me, Dad.

1591
01:28:45,490 --> 01:28:46,620
Doesn't she, Pete?

1592
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,260
Yeah, you look really good.

1593
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:51,640
Once again, that's the right answer.

1594
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,450
Is that a corsage?

1595
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,100
Thanks.

1596
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:59,162
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur, so...

1597
01:28:59,887 --> 01:29:01,104
let's get this show on the road.

1598
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:03,125
No, no, no, no, we have
to take some pictures, babe.

1599
01:29:03,550 --> 01:29:04,220
All right.

1600
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,030
Right here. Perfect.
Mom.

1601
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,170
Ok. Come on, you guys.

1602
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:10,000
Peter, closer.

1603
01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:13,520
Smile.

1604
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,780
There you go.

1605
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:25,250
Sir, you don't have to drive us.
No, no, it's not a big deal.

1606
01:29:25,410 --> 01:29:27,630
I'm going out of town.
It's right on my way.

1607
01:29:27,790 --> 01:29:29,710
He's always going. Have fun.
Last time.

1608
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:31,150
Thank you.
Promise.

1609
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:32,540
He's cute.

1610
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,210
See you in a couple of days. All right.
Bye, baby.

1611
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:38,960
Come on, Pedro.

1612
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:41,350
Bye, Peter. Have fun.
Yeah, I will.

1613
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:52,955
What are you gonna do, Pete?

1614
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,334
What?

1615
01:29:54,770 --> 01:29:56,610
When you graduate,
what do you think you'll do?

1616
01:29:57,090 --> 01:29:59,280
I don't. I don't know.
Don't grill him, Dad.

1617
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:01,830
Just saying, you know.

1618
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,950
All you guys who go to that school...

1619
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:06,440
you pretty much have
your life planned out, right?

1620
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,250
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.

1621
01:30:09,410 --> 01:30:11,413
Peter has an internship with Tony Stark.

1622
01:30:11,538 --> 01:30:13,164
So I think he doesn't have to worry.

1623
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:14,540
Really?

1624
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:15,590
Stark?

1625
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:16,780
So cool.

1626
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:19,380
What do you do?

1627
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:22,970
Yeah, actually,
I don't intern for him anymore.

1628
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,091
Seriously?

1629
01:30:24,116 --> 01:30:25,230
Yeah, it got...

1630
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:27,140
boring.

1631
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:28,300
It was boring?

1632
01:30:28,725 --> 01:30:30,194
You got to hang out
with Spider-Man.

1633
01:30:30,430 --> 01:30:32,360
Really? Spider-Man?

1634
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:35,300
What's he like?

1635
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,930
Yeah, he's nice.

1636
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:39,430
Nice man.

1637
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:41,430
Solid dude.

1638
01:30:44,950 --> 01:30:47,040
Look. So cute.

1639
01:30:52,410 --> 01:30:54,730
I've seen you around, right? I mean.
I mean...

1640
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:56,500
somewhere. We've...

1641
01:30:56,670 --> 01:30:57,727
Have we ever...

1642
01:30:57,852 --> 01:30:58,879
Because even the voice...

1643
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,010
He does Academic Decathlon with me.

1644
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:03,090
And he was at my party.

1645
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,140
It was a great party, really great, yeah.

1646
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,070
Beautiful house, a lot of windows.

1647
01:31:09,095 --> 01:31:10,744
You were there for like, 2 seconds.

1648
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:14,140
That was... I was there longer
than 2 seconds.

1649
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:15,821
You disappeared.

1650
01:31:15,846 --> 01:31:18,034
No. No, I did not disappear.

1651
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:20,620
Yes, you did. You disappeared
like you always do,

1652
01:31:20,644 --> 01:31:21,974
like you did in D.C. too.

1653
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:33,170
That's terrible what happened
down there in D.C., though.

1654
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:34,660
Were you scared?

1655
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,160
I'll bet you were glad when your old pal
Spider-Man showed up in the elevator.

1656
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:45,260
Yeah, well, I. I actually didn't go up.

1657
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:47,180
I saw it all from the ground.

1658
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:49,180
Yeah.

1659
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,590
Very lucky that he was there that day.

1660
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:57,400
Good old Spider-Man.

1661
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:03,400
Dad, the light.

1662
01:32:18,790 --> 01:32:19,809
Here we are.

1663
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:21,134
End of the line.

1664
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:22,290
Thanks, Dad.

1665
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,590
You head in there, gumdrop.

1666
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:27,610
I'm gonna give Peter the... dad talk.

1667
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:30,950
Don't let him intimidate you.

1668
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:32,630
Love you.

1669
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:34,460
Love you, gumdrop.
Have a safe flight.

1670
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:36,530
Hi.

1671
01:32:37,770 --> 01:32:40,070
You guys look so pretty.

1672
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:45,950
Does she know?

1673
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:48,280
Know what?

1674
01:32:48,450 --> 01:32:50,200
So she doesn't. Good.

1675
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:51,640
Close to the vest.

1676
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:53,370
I admire that.

1677
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:55,260
I've got a few secrets of my own.

1678
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:59,330
Of all the reasons
I didn't want my daughter to date...

1679
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:03,310
Peter...

1680
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:06,349
nothing is more important than family.

1681
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:08,050
You saved my daughter's life.

1682
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:10,060
I could never forget something like that.

1683
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:11,970
So I'm gonna give you one chance.

1684
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:13,260
Are you ready?

1685
01:33:13,970 --> 01:33:17,070
You walk through those doors,
you forget any of this happened...

1686
01:33:17,390 --> 01:33:19,970
and don't you ever, ever...

1687
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:23,130
interfere with my business again.

1688
01:33:23,690 --> 01:33:25,210
Because if you do...

1689
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:27,330
I'll kill you...

1690
01:33:28,190 --> 01:33:29,790
and everybody you love.

1691
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:32,870
I'll kill you dead.

1692
01:33:33,030 --> 01:33:34,858
That's what I'll do to protect my family, Pete.

1693
01:33:34,983 --> 01:33:36,054
Do you understand?

1694
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:38,740
Hey.

1695
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:42,010
I just saved your life.

1696
01:33:42,235 --> 01:33:43,944
Now, what do you say?

1697
01:33:46,130 --> 01:33:47,130
Thank you.

1698
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:48,980
You're welcome.

1699
01:33:49,550 --> 01:33:54,800
Now, you go on in there and you show
my daughter a good time, Ok?

1700
01:33:55,850 --> 01:33:57,320
Just not too good.

1701
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:52,450
Hey.

1702
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:56,330
What did he say to you?

1703
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:02,000
Gotta go.

1704
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:05,240
I'm sorry.

1705
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,540
You don't deserve this.

1706
01:35:29,270 --> 01:35:30,620
He gave you a choice.

1707
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:32,870
You chose wrong.
What the hell?

1708
01:35:33,030 --> 01:35:34,600
What's with the crappy costume?

1709
01:35:37,110 --> 01:35:38,330
My web-shooters.

1710
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:49,650
I wasn't sure about
this thing at first, but...

1711
01:35:50,974 --> 01:35:51,874
Damn!

1712
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,190
Gross.

1713
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:11,540
Why did he send you here?

1714
01:36:11,865 --> 01:36:13,144
Guess you'll never know.

1715
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:19,160
Nice shot!

1716
01:36:24,490 --> 01:36:25,490
Yes!

1717
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:27,930
Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz's dad.

1718
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:29,870
What?
I know. I gotta tell Mr. Stark.

1719
01:36:30,030 --> 01:36:32,280
Call Happy Hogan.
He's Mr. Stark's head of security.

1720
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:34,300
And get a computer
and track my phone for me.

1721
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:35,517
Will you be Ok?

1722
01:36:35,518 --> 01:36:37,680
Hurry, we gotta catch him
before he leaves town.

1723
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:40,260
I'm sorry about dinner but...

1724
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:43,945
I know when branzino's fresh,
and that was not fresh, Ok?

1725
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:44,794
So...

1726
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:47,950
Flash, I need your car and phone.

1727
01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:50,830
Sir, technically,
this is my dad's car, sir. So I can't...

1728
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:01,380
Hello, Ned?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, can you hear me?

1729
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:02,410
Go for Ned.

1730
01:37:03,034 --> 01:37:03,534
<i>Ned.</i>

1731
01:37:03,558 --> 01:37:05,008
I need you to track my phone for me.

1732
01:37:05,033 --> 01:37:06,034
Yeah, but where is it?

1733
01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:13,390
Genius move. Ok, he just passed
the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.

1734
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:15,449
Hey, where are the headlights on this thing?

1735
01:37:15,674 --> 01:37:16,664
I'm in Flash's car.

1736
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:17,955
I'll pull the specs.

1737
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:19,340
Ok, you're on speakerphone.

1738
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,360
You stole Flash's car. Awesome.

1739
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:22,695
Yeah, it's awesome. It's...

1740
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,810
Get out of the way,
get out of the way! Move! Move!

1741
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:28,030
Peter, you Ok?
<i>I've never driven before,</i>

1742
01:37:28,070 --> 01:37:29,435
only with May in parking lots.

1743
01:37:29,459 --> 01:37:30,964
This is a huge step up.

1744
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,000
<i>Hey, have you gotten through
to Happy yet?</i>

1745
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:35,970
Yeah. I'm working on it.

1746
01:37:35,995 --> 01:37:37,494
I just gotta battle
through the phone system.

1747
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:43,500
Guy in the chair.

1748
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:50,140
<i>Takeoff in nine minutes.</i>

1749
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:51,740
<i>Hello? Hello? Who is this?</i>

1750
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:53,520
Mr. Happy, it's Ned.
<i>Who?</i>

1751
01:37:53,810 --> 01:37:54,974
I'm an associate of Peter Parker.

1752
01:37:55,099 --> 01:37:56,169
Got something very
important to tell you...

1753
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:57,320
<i>You gotta be shitting me.</i>

1754
01:37:58,420 --> 01:37:59,420
Damn.

1755
01:37:59,630 --> 01:38:01,510
Hey, Ned, how we coming on
with those headlights?

1756
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:05,705
Round knob to the left
of the steering wheel,

1757
01:38:05,730 --> 01:38:06,564
<i>turn clockwise.</i>

1758
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:07,790
Left, Ok.

1759
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:10,050
Ok, perfect.
<i>So where's my phone now?</i>

1760
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:13,160
He stopped in an old industrial park
in Brooklyn.

1761
01:38:13,190 --> 01:38:15,990
What? That makes no sense.
He said he was going out of town.

1762
01:38:16,150 --> 01:38:18,189
<i>Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.</i>

1763
01:38:18,190 --> 01:38:19,594
Don't think he likes you, by the way.

1764
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:21,210
It sounded like he was catching a flight.

1765
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:23,159
<i>He said something about
taking off in nine minutes.</i>

1766
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:24,660
What?
He was surrounded by boxes.

1767
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:26,680
Boxes? It's moving day.

1768
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:28,810
It's moving day. Moving day.
He's gonna rob that plane.

1769
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:30,050
I gotta stop him!

1770
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,710
All right, wheels up in eight minutes.

1771
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:38,570
We just got to load
Tony's old Hulkbuster armor,

1772
01:38:38,630 --> 01:38:40,550
prototype for Cap's new shield,

1773
01:38:40,775 --> 01:38:41,974
and the Meging...

1774
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:43,760
The Meg... The...

1775
01:38:43,930 --> 01:38:45,100
Thor's magic belt.

1776
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:47,298
<i>Ok, slow down.</i>

1777
01:38:47,623 --> 01:38:49,001
You're getting close.
<i>It's on your right.</i>

1778
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:50,520
What?
<i>Turn right. Turn right.</i>

1779
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:02,360
Peter. Are you Ok?
Yeah.

1780
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:04,540
Just keep trying to get through to Happy.

1781
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:07,170
It's been an honor, Spider-Man.

1782
01:39:08,530 --> 01:39:10,050
What are you doing here?
There's a dance.

1783
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:15,540
I'm...

1784
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:16,750
looking...

1785
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:18,980
at porn.

1786
01:39:57,670 --> 01:39:58,710
Hey!

1787
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:01,530
Surprised?

1788
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:03,170
Oh, hey, Pete.

1789
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:05,680
I didn't hear you come in.

1790
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,930
It's over. I've got you.

1791
01:40:08,090 --> 01:40:10,090
You know, I gotta tell you, Pete...

1792
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:13,300
I really, really admire your grit.

1793
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:16,560
I see why Liz likes you.

1794
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,740
I do.

1795
01:40:19,865 --> 01:40:21,576
When you first came to
the house I wasn't sure.

1796
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,504
I thought, Really?
But I get it now.

1797
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:26,160
How could you do this to her?

1798
01:40:26,530 --> 01:40:28,799
To her? I'm not doing
anything to her, Pete.

1799
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,740
I'm doing this for her.

1800
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:32,340
Yeah.

1801
01:40:36,620 --> 01:40:37,790
Peter...

1802
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,100
you're young.

1803
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:42,420
You don't understand
how the world works.

1804
01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:45,540
Yeah but I understand that selling
weapons to criminals is wrong.

1805
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:48,360
How do you think your buddy
Stark paid for that tower?

1806
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:49,790
Or any of his little toys?

1807
01:40:50,050 --> 01:40:53,076
Those people Pete, those people up
there, the rich and the powerful,

1808
01:40:53,301 --> 01:40:55,280
they do whatever they want.
Guys like us.

1809
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:57,630
Like you and me.

1810
01:40:58,390 --> 01:40:59,760
They don't care about us.

1811
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:03,400
We build their roads and we fight
all their wars and everything,

1812
01:41:03,625 --> 01:41:04,774
but they don't care about us.

1813
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:08,180
We have to pick up after them.
We have to eat their table scraps.

1814
01:41:10,530 --> 01:41:11,930
That's how it is.

1815
01:41:12,910 --> 01:41:15,000
I know you know
what I'm talking about, Peter.

1816
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:16,710
Why are you telling me this?

1817
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:19,350
Because I want you to understand.

1818
01:41:19,710 --> 01:41:20,710
And...

1819
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:23,290
I needed a little time to get her airborne.

1820
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:38,310
I'm sorry, Peter.

1821
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:45,440
What are you talking about?
That thing hasn't even touched me yet.

1822
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:47,550
True. Then again...

1823
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:49,840
wasn't really trying to.

1824
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:57,420
<i>Chief, they're powering up engines.</i>

1825
01:41:57,580 --> 01:41:59,420
Ok. Yeah, yeah.
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

1826
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:53,180
Ok, ready?

1827
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:03,770
Hello?

1828
01:43:06,940 --> 01:43:08,410
Hello!

1829
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:10,060
Please, hey.

1830
01:43:10,570 --> 01:43:12,860
Hey, please. I'm down here.

1831
01:43:13,030 --> 01:43:14,800
I'm down here. I'm stuck.

1832
01:43:15,150 --> 01:43:17,250
I'm stuck. I can't move. I can't...

1833
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:38,110
<i>If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.</i>

1834
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:45,730
Come on, Peter.

1835
01:43:46,690 --> 01:43:48,130
Come on, Spider-Man.

1836
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,860
Come on, Spider-Man.

1837
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:51,940
Come on, Spider-Man.

1838
01:43:54,610 --> 01:43:56,190
Come on, Spider-Man!

1839
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:49,900
Launch for intercept.
Green light. Green light.

1840
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:51,210
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1841
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:08,900
Retroreflective panels engaged.

1842
01:45:20,910 --> 01:45:23,830
Got a visual on the plane,
but I'm feeling a little resistance.

1843
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:25,970
<i>It's probably just drag
on the new turbines.</i>

1844
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:41,760
<i>Look out for the cloaking cameras.
Stay in the blind spots.</i>

1845
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:53,810
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1846
01:45:54,150 --> 01:45:56,570
Deploying high-altitude vacuum seal.

1847
01:45:56,730 --> 01:45:58,280
<i>This better work, Mason.</i>

1848
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:06,870
<i>Trust me, boss, even one of
those boxes and we are set for life.</i>

1849
01:46:07,230 --> 01:46:08,330
<i>Yeah.</i>

1850
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:23,580
<i>You have 30 seconds to get to the
cockpit and override their security.</i>

1851
01:46:35,730 --> 01:46:37,280
<i>Cloning transponder signal.</i>

1852
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,110
Launching decoy drone.

1853
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:44,670
Entering new coordinates.

1854
01:46:51,370 --> 01:46:52,610
Good, so it's on its way.

1855
01:46:52,710 --> 01:46:54,750
Yes, sir, right on course.
Ok, thank you.

1856
01:46:56,380 --> 01:46:57,600
All right.

1857
01:47:10,310 --> 01:47:11,730
Hot dog.

1858
01:48:01,570 --> 01:48:03,310
Just a typical homecoming,

1859
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:05,490
on the outside of an invisible jet...

1860
01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:08,110
fighting my girlfriend's dad.

1861
01:48:18,250 --> 01:48:19,340
Oh, God!

1862
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:29,020
I can't believe that worked. Whoa!

1863
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:07,046
Chief, Chief, you're losing altitude.

1864
01:49:07,071 --> 01:49:07,784
<i>Get out of there.</i>

1865
01:49:07,820 --> 01:49:09,200
<i>I'm not going home empty-handed.</i>

1866
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:20,550
Oh, my God.

1867
01:49:35,660 --> 01:49:37,106
<i>Get out. What are you doing?</i>

1868
01:49:37,131 --> 01:49:38,524
Please turn, please turn!

1869
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:14,680
<i>Hey, Pedro.</i>

1870
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:03,650
Bingo.

1871
01:52:19,820 --> 01:52:21,620
Your wingsuit.

1872
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:23,880
Your wingsuit's going to explode!

1873
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:32,720
Time to go home, Pete.

1874
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,350
I'm trying to save you!

1875
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:50,560
No.

1876
01:52:51,610 --> 01:52:52,610
No.

1877
01:54:32,710 --> 01:54:34,630
It looked so insane. That whole...

1878
01:54:34,990 --> 01:54:36,230
Like, it was just crazy.

1879
01:54:36,290 --> 01:54:37,670
He... He was just like...

1880
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:39,940
And you were like...

1881
01:54:41,010 --> 01:54:42,380
And then I just hit him with the...

1882
01:54:43,050 --> 01:54:44,254
It was so. Oh, my God.

1883
01:54:45,090 --> 01:54:46,200
You saved me.

1884
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:48,660
Awesome.

1885
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:56,170
Hey, Liz.

1886
01:54:58,270 --> 01:54:59,450
I'm gonna miss you.

1887
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:00,940
Bye.

1888
01:55:02,150 --> 01:55:03,150
Liz.

1889
01:55:10,450 --> 01:55:11,970
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.

1890
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:15,010
You say that a lot.
What are you sorry for this time?

1891
01:55:17,130 --> 01:55:18,270
The dance?

1892
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:22,460
That... was a pretty crappy thing to do.

1893
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:23,870
Yeah but I...

1894
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:26,270
I mean your dad. I can't imagine
what you're going through.

1895
01:55:26,930 --> 01:55:28,700
If there's anything I can do to help...

1896
01:55:29,260 --> 01:55:31,370
I guess we're moving to Oregon.

1897
01:55:31,930 --> 01:55:35,290
Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.

1898
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:39,300
Anyways, Dad doesn't want us here
during the trial. So...

1899
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:43,280
Liz, I... I...

1900
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:45,720
Bye Peter.

1901
01:55:46,990 --> 01:55:49,690
Whatever's going on with you,
I hope you figure it out.

1902
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,550
Congratulations,
decathlon national champions.

1903
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:07,760
Yeah!

1904
01:56:09,130 --> 01:56:11,650
I'm gonna have to put this back
in the trophy case soon but,

1905
01:56:11,710 --> 01:56:13,920
just for motivation right now
at this practice.

1906
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:15,560
I'm a little ahead of the game but,

1907
01:56:15,584 --> 01:56:17,560
we will need a new team captain next year.

1908
01:56:17,730 --> 01:56:20,200
So I am appointing Michelle.

1909
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:22,400
Yeah!

1910
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:26,490
Thank you.

1911
01:56:26,650 --> 01:56:28,220
My... My friends call me MJ.

1912
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:30,390
I thought you didn't have any friends.

1913
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:32,270
I didn't.

1914
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:38,731
I... gotta go.

1915
01:56:38,732 --> 01:56:39,974
Hey, where you going?

1916
01:56:42,460 --> 01:56:44,390
What are you hiding, Peter?

1917
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:48,380
I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.

1918
01:56:48,630 --> 01:56:51,010
All right, so we should run some drills.
Yeah.

1919
01:56:59,730 --> 01:57:00,565
Hey, Happy.

1920
01:57:00,790 --> 01:57:01,716
What...

1921
01:57:02,441 --> 01:57:03,518
What are you doing here?

1922
01:57:04,020 --> 01:57:05,280
I really owe you one.

1923
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:09,160
I don't know what I would do
without this job.

1924
01:57:09,820 --> 01:57:11,420
I mean, before I met Tony...

1925
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:43,440
So... how long you been here?

1926
01:57:43,610 --> 01:57:44,842
Long enough to be awkward.

1927
01:57:44,867 --> 01:57:46,004
Boss wants to see you.

1928
01:57:46,730 --> 01:57:47,612
Is he here too?

1929
01:57:47,937 --> 01:57:49,734
In the toilet? No, he's upstate.

1930
01:57:50,150 --> 01:57:51,700
Upstate.. Like, upstate upstate?

1931
01:57:51,820 --> 01:57:52,910
Yeah, let's go.

1932
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:55,910
Take a look.

1933
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:57,220
It's pretty impressive?

1934
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:00,960
They just finished remodeling
the whole thing.

1935
01:58:28,090 --> 01:58:29,259
You don't see that every day.

1936
01:58:29,684 --> 01:58:30,864
There they are.

1937
01:58:31,900 --> 01:58:33,130
How was the ride up?

1938
01:58:33,950 --> 01:58:34,608
Good.

1939
01:58:34,633 --> 01:58:35,905
Give me a minute with the kid.

1940
01:58:37,330 --> 01:58:38,470
Seriously?
Yeah.

1941
01:58:39,580 --> 01:58:40,960
I gotta talk to the kid.

1942
01:58:41,540 --> 01:58:42,630
I'll be close behind.

1943
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:44,206
How about a loose follow?

1944
01:58:44,431 --> 01:58:45,564
All right? Boundaries are good.

1945
01:58:51,550 --> 01:58:52,770
Sorry I took your suit.

1946
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:54,089
I mean, you had it coming.

1947
01:58:54,214 --> 01:58:57,959
Actually, it turns out, it was the perfect, sort
of tough love moment that you needed, right?

1948
01:58:57,960 --> 01:59:00,510
To urge you on, right?
Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?

1949
01:59:00,770 --> 01:59:02,360
I guess.
Let's just say it was.

1950
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:07,560
Mr. Stark, I really...
You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.

1951
01:59:08,270 --> 01:59:09,850
But then you did the right thing.

1952
01:59:10,110 --> 01:59:13,580
Took the dog to the free clinic,
you raised the hybrid puppies.

1953
01:59:13,650 --> 01:59:14,820
All right, not my best analogy.

1954
01:59:16,530 --> 01:59:17,750
I was wrong about you.

1955
01:59:18,990 --> 01:59:20,750
I think, with a little more mentoring...

1956
01:59:21,410 --> 01:59:23,180
you could be a real asset to the team.

1957
01:59:25,670 --> 01:59:27,510
To the... To the team?
Yeah. Anyway...

1958
01:59:27,870 --> 01:59:30,520
there's about 50 reporters behind
that door. Real ones, not bloggers.

1959
01:59:31,210 --> 01:59:33,060
When you're ready...

1960
01:59:33,420 --> 01:59:34,940
why don't you try that on?

1961
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:37,204
And I'll introduce the world,

1962
01:59:37,305 --> 01:59:39,354
to the newest official
member of the Avengers,

1963
01:59:39,490 --> 01:59:40,560
Spider-Man.

1964
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:44,520
I...

1965
01:59:46,770 --> 01:59:48,320
Yeah, give that a look.

1966
01:59:54,530 --> 01:59:57,960
So after the press conference, Happy will
show you to your room, your new quarters.

1967
01:59:58,210 --> 02:00:00,270
Where's he between?
He's next to Vision?

1968
02:00:00,530 --> 02:00:02,890
Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.
It's fun.

1969
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:04,200
Or walls.

1970
02:00:04,450 --> 02:00:05,830
You'll fit right in.

1971
02:00:12,750 --> 02:00:14,060
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

1972
02:00:15,220 --> 02:00:16,370
But I'm good.

1973
02:00:17,510 --> 02:00:18,726
You're good? Good?

1974
02:00:18,951 --> 02:00:20,034
How are you good?

1975
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:24,350
Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay
on the ground for a little while.

1976
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:26,390
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

1977
02:00:26,850 --> 02:00:28,930
Somebody's got to look out
for the little guy, right?

1978
02:00:29,270 --> 02:00:30,740
You're turning me down?

1979
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:32,490
You better think about this.
Look at that.

1980
02:00:33,150 --> 02:00:34,300
Look at me.

1981
02:00:35,150 --> 02:00:36,240
Last chance. Yes or no?

1982
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:37,600
No.
Ok.

1983
02:00:37,860 --> 02:00:40,970
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,
working-class hero vibe that I dig.

1984
02:00:41,630 --> 02:00:43,240
Happy will take you home.

1985
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:44,700
Yeah?
Yeah.

1986
02:00:45,370 --> 02:00:47,240
Mind waiting in the car?
I need a minute.

1987
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:51,660
Thank you, Mr. Stark.
Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.

1988
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:53,040
See you around.
Ok.

1989
02:01:01,850 --> 02:01:03,160
That was a test, right?

1990
02:01:03,850 --> 02:01:06,420
There's nobody back there?
Yes, you passed.

1991
02:01:07,180 --> 02:01:08,658
All right skedaddle there.

1992
02:01:08,659 --> 02:01:10,284
Thank you, Mr. Stark. Thank you.
Young buck.

1993
02:01:10,330 --> 02:01:11,650
Yeah, thank you.

1994
02:01:14,020 --> 02:01:15,300
Told you he's a good kid.

1995
02:01:22,160 --> 02:01:23,730
Where's the kid?
He left.

1996
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:24,580
Everybody's waiting.

1997
02:01:24,604 --> 02:01:26,734
You know he actually made
a really mature choice.

1998
02:01:26,970 --> 02:01:28,639
It just surprised the heck out of us.

1999
02:01:28,864 --> 02:01:29,994
Did you screw this up?

2000
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:31,393
He told the kid to go wait in the car.

2001
02:01:31,417 --> 02:01:32,370
Are you kidding me?

2002
02:01:32,490 --> 02:01:35,543
I have a room full of people in there
waiting for some big announcement.

2003
02:01:35,568 --> 02:01:36,561
What will I tell them?

2004
02:01:36,590 --> 02:01:38,390
Think of something.
How about...

2005
02:01:39,630 --> 02:01:41,035
Hap, you still got that ring?

2006
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:41,934
Do I... I...

2007
02:01:41,970 --> 02:01:43,280
The engagement ring.
Are you kidding?

2008
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:45,620
I've been carrying this since 2008.

2009
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:50,210
Ok.

2010
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:52,200
I think I can think
of something better than that.

2011
02:01:52,230 --> 02:01:54,610
Well, it would buy us a little time.

2012
02:01:55,900 --> 02:01:57,430
Like we need time.

2013
02:01:58,190 --> 02:02:00,000
I can't believe you have that
in your pocket.

2014
02:02:00,030 --> 02:02:01,630
Want me to get the door for you, hon?
I got it.

2015
02:02:18,710 --> 02:02:20,380
Aunt May, did you do dinner already?

2016
02:02:31,430 --> 02:02:32,510
May?

2017
02:02:54,870 --> 02:02:55,920
What the fu...

2018

<font color="#ffff80"><i>Sync & corrections October 2017</i></font>

2019
02:05:10,010 --> 02:05:11,980
Look who it is.

2020
02:05:13,890 --> 02:05:16,860
What are the odds you and I'd end up
at the same summer camp?

2021
02:05:17,230 --> 02:05:18,520
Relax.

2022
02:05:19,140 --> 02:05:21,150
This? It's not on you.

2023
02:05:21,310 --> 02:05:24,210
It's on our, little spider friend.

2024
02:05:24,570 --> 02:05:28,160
I've got some boys on the outside
who would love to meet him.

2025
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:29,577
You know, take a picture,

2026
02:05:29,602 --> 02:05:31,814
slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.

2027
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:34,480
And I heard a rumor.

2028
02:05:37,830 --> 02:05:39,420
You know who he is.

2029
02:05:43,170 --> 02:05:45,110
If I knew who he was...

2030
02:05:45,670 --> 02:05:47,260
he'd already be dead.

2031
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:54,580
Toomes, your family's here!

2032
02:12:33,790 --> 02:12:36,134
Hi, I'm Captain America,

2033
02:12:36,335 --> 02:12:40,260
here to talk to you about one of the most
valuable traits a soldier or student can have.

2034
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:42,290
Patience.

2035
02:12:42,750 --> 02:12:44,880
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.

2036
02:12:45,050 --> 02:12:47,100
Sometimes it leads to very little,

2037
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:49,100
and it seems like it's not worth it.

2038
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:50,760
And you wonder...

2039
02:12:51,430 --> 02:12:54,580
why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.

2040
02:12:58,980 --> 02:13:00,180
How many more of these?
