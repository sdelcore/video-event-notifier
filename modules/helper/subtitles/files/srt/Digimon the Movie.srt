1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,989
This is it, Digipals.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,675
In a few seconds, the doors will open
for the best movie of all time.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,318
A Digimon movie.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,994
Seven hours of waiting in line
and skipping breakfast...

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,559
...have finally paid off.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,909
Nanette Manoir.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,116
The end of the line starts at the end.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,918
Au contraire, Angela Anaconda.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,355
The end is for riffraff, which is French for:

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,396
Those who must wait
since they don't have...

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,879
...all-access, VlP passes.

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,235
But thanks ever so
for keeping our spot warm.

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,550
"Thanks for keeping our spot warm."

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,076
We are going to have to get digidrastic
if we want to get the best seats.

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,718
Get ready to rumble.

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,749
Hey, wait up! I was first in line!

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,359
Saved!

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,193
Guys? Where are my best friends?

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,517
Refills are free, right?

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,033
Taken! Sorry! Saved! Back up, Grandma!

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,032
That's it!
If my friends do not get here soon--

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,079
Popcorn! Thanks, Johnny Abatti.

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,478
Digimon! Digimon!

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,832
We're about to have the best view
of the best movie, in the best seats ever!

25
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,151
Hats, view, blocking!

26
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,397
S'il vous plait, Angela Anaconda.

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,359
As if we would ever be so gauche
as to wear them in the actual theater.

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,748
Mrs. Brinks, we saved you a seat.

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,910
Enjoy the show, Angela Anaconda.

30
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,316
So Mrs. Brinks and Ninny-poo think
they can block the Digimon show...

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,517
...with their big, fat,
Digimon-blocking heads, do they?

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,397
Well, not for long.

33
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,396
Angela Anaconda,
digivolve to Angelamon!

34
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,553
Well, look who's here.
Ninnymon and her Brinksimonster robot...

35
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,598
...come to block our view
of the entire world.

36
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,631
Prepare for battle, you pathetic Pukimon.

37
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,676
But first, let's make some concessions.

38
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,718
After all, refills are free. Right, Ginamon?

39
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,754
"Help me, Angelamon, more powerful
Digimon than l", you will cry.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,831
Don't worry, Ninny-whinnymon.

41
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,878
My pal Johnnymon is here
to give you a kick-start.

42
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,118
And now, get ready for my ultimate,
anti-Ninnymon...

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,270
...super-secret powers.

44
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,595
Angela!

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,595
Angelamon! Angelamon!

46
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,079
Digimon!

47
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,395
-Digimon!
-Excusez-moi, but if you common...

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,869
...Iine waiters can't adhere
to theater etiquette...

49
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,190
...then I'll be forced to summon an usher.

50
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,712
Oh, Guinevere,
je t'aime depuis le premier jour.

51
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,996
I've loved you since the first day.

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,199
This isn't Digimon!

53
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,714
This is some boring, phony,
fake French film.

54
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,028
But that means....

55
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,271
We're in the wrong theater.

56
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,717
I called dibs on the best seats!

57
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,839
Good heavens!

58
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,514
Who says,
"There's no such thing as monsters "?

59
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,157
You're never quite the same
after you meet your first Digimon.

60
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,596
My name's Kari. I'm part of a team
called the DigiDestined.

61
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,593
There were a handful of us at first, but
we've added a few members since then.

62
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,478
That's me with T.K.,
another one of the DigiDestined.

63
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,357
And that's Willis, in America.

64
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,989
While the rest of us in Japan
only had one Digimon, he had twins.

65
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,150
And while we had our team to count on...

66
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,789
... Willis didn't have any human friends,
only his two Digimon.

67
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,112
His digital adventures, as well as ours,
began that night, eight years ago.

68
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,070
Did you know there are
actually two worlds?

69
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,037
Our world and the Digital World.

70
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,271
Now, don't plan a vacation there.
I'm not even sure where it is.

71
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,433
But when I first saw it, I was so scared,
I was so nervous, I was so cute.

72
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,148
That's my brother Tai,
when he was a little kid.

73
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,676
Even back then, he was a born leader.
Brave, strong and graceful.

74
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,231
That night started like every other one.

75
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,039
Tai was making his fourth trip
to the bathroom.

76
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,118
Kari, what are you doing in here?

77
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,395
You're not supposed to play
with the computer.

78
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,072
But it's doing something weird.

79
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,310
I was right. It was our first DigiEgg.

80
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,913
On the other side of the world...

81
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,151
... Willis was getting his DigiEgg
at the exact same time.

82
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,794
Tai, wake up!

83
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,193
Tai! I'm going to the health-food store.

84
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,953
What a weird dream. A computer egg?

85
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,117
I gotta stop watching scary movies
before I go to bed.

86
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,439
Take care of your sister.

87
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,398
But, Mom,
I was gonna play soccer with my friends!

88
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,074
The egg's real!

89
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,392
I bet you this is gonna taste
a lot better than your egg.

90
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,994
I know what we can do.
Let's use it as a soccer ball.

91
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,718
You're right,
it probably wouldn't bounce that high.

92
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,718
If anyone asks
where that weird-looking egg came from...

93
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,837
...Iet's tell them our chicken coop
is on a nuclear-waste dump.

94
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,230
The rest of the kids
are gonna be jealous of us this Easter.

95
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,394
Kari, where'd you go?

96
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,638
Kari, l--

97
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,598
It's alive!

98
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,671
Oh, it's cute. Come here, little baby.

99
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,398
Kari, stay away! I'll protect you.

100
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,237
As usual, Tai came up with
a brave plan of action.

101
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,039
It worked about as well as his other plans.

102
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,231
It's taking a bubble bath.

103
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,871
That was the first time any of us
really connected with a Digimon.

104
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,033
As time went on, we learned that
not all Digimon turn out to be so friendly.

105
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,518
Kari, stop feeding it so many candy bars.
You'll make it sick.

106
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,433
Hey, those are mine! Thanks a lot.

107
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,318
Well, now that it's here,
how do we get rid of it?

108
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,113
We can't keep it.

109
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,072
Where's it gonna sleep?

110
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,718
Oh, no, not in my bed!

111
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,435
Fine, then it sleeps on the couch.

112
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,672
I guess we'll just have to tell Mom
it's a throw pillow.

113
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,679
I'll get it.

114
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,753
Hello? Tai speaking.

115
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,037
This is Sora. Mimi told me
you were the one who threw up in my hat.

116
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,031
Something's wrong with her phone.

117
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,394
Perfect timing.

118
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,790
That's weird. All the electronic stuff
in the house is going nuts.

119
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,393
Kari, look out!

120
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,749
It changed. It got bigger.
What did you do? Oh, no.

121
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,350
Where are we gonna hide him?
What's Mom gonna say if she finds out?

122
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,351
It can't get any worse.

123
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,950
It just got worse.

124
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,112
4,008, 4,009, 4,01 0, 4,01 1, 4,01 2....

125
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,556
You'd better pin his ears back
so they don't get in the food.

126
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,348
Boy, he looks pretty hungry.

127
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,713
He had a strange way
of showing his appreciation.

128
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,157
Cut it out! Stop kissing my sister, you!

129
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,634
His breath stinks!

130
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,869
I've had enough. He's outta here.

131
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,149
We don't make much of a tag team, do we?

132
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,832
Kids, I made your favorite: liver sticks.

133
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,991
Great! In a minute.

134
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,318
-So, do you have a name?
-Koromon.

135
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,877
We're in luck. She burned them.

136
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,599
-Tai, his name is Koromon.
-Whose name?

137
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,318
Koromon, what are you anyway?

138
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,359
I'm a Digimon, short for Digital Monster.
I'm from the Digital World.

139
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,238
How come you talk to him,
and only whistle at me?

140
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,515
My name is Kari. Kari.

141
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,792
And this is my brother.
His name is Tai. Tai.

142
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,514
-Hi, Kari-Kari, Tai-Tai.
-Never mind.

143
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,478
He can talk.

144
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,235
-You two are the best friends I ever had.
-We're the only friends you've had.

145
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,597
Thanks for saving me
from that scratching fur-ball.

146
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,429
Just warn me before you kiss me again.

147
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,038
Once a Digimon truly becomes your friend,
they'll do anything for you.

148
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,874
Anything.

149
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,311
Let's have a warning for this, too.

150
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,837
Every time that thing changed shape,
or what we now call "digivolved"...

151
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,952
...there was a weird electrical surge
throughout the city.

152
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,635
Of course, there was only one way
to get Tai's attention.

153
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,399
I'm up. What?

154
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,074
Koromon? What's the matter with him?
Is he sick?

155
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,993
You gave him your liver sticks, didn't you?

156
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,272
You should know that this Koromon
isn't the one we befriended later on.

157
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,953
Look! That's gotta hurt.

158
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,472
When this one digivolved, he expanded
more than my Uncle Fred at Thanksgiving.

159
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,473
Nice dinosaur. Friendly dinosaur.

160
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,877
Kari, get down from there!
What are you doing?

161
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,676
I'm gonna get grounded for this.

162
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,558
What's going on in there?
Did you kids break another lamp?

163
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,959
Piggyback?

164
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,553
Kari, no!

165
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,955
Now let's play horsey.

166
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,277
If Mom's worried about the lamp,
wait till she sees her car!

167
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,555
Look both ways
before you cross the street.

168
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,596
See any cars?

169
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,114
Do you even know what a car is?

170
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,031
Just be careful, then.

171
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,790
Soda. I'm thirsty. Are you?

172
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,475
Mom usually just puts money in,
but I guess that works too.

173
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,319
Just one each.

174
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,637
Where are you going?

175
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,471
How hard could it be to find a dinosaur?

176
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,677
You know,
we really shouldn't be playing in the street.

177
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,995
-Did you see that?
-No, I was sleeping.

178
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,798
But you're driving!

179
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,916
-Can we do that ride again?
-Pepper Flame.

180
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,318
Tai wasn't far behind us. He was following
our footprints in the diet soda.

181
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,157
Why are you looking at that bus?
Please don't blow it up.

182
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,515
I know my mom says they're always late...

183
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,876
...but they can't help it.
Don't be a bad boy!

184
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,592
I wanna go home now, okay?

185
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,435
Oh, boy!

186
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,030
And that's when we saw
our second DigiEgg.

187
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,999
But this one was a lot bigger,
and the Digimon inside it, a lot meaner.

188
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,873
I'd hate to see the chicken
that egg came out of.

189
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,589
That's a big bird.

190
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,356
Pepper Flame!

191
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,870
Mimi, it's Joe.
Quick, look outside your window.

192
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,316
Polly want a cracker? A really big cracker?

193
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,788
Koromon? Kari!

194
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,592
-Koromon, please don't fight!
-Kari, come on, we gotta go!

195
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,278
-Koromon!
-Kari, it's too dangerous!

196
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,950
Pepper Flame!

197
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,754
My turn.

198
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,309
Sonic Destroyer!

199
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,358
Izzy, did you see that?
What's wrong with the phone?

200
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,678
-You okay?
-Who's that?

201
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,918
Koromon?

202
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,791
I'm Greymon now.

203
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,390
You can be whoever you want, big guy.

204
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,993
Nova Flame!

205
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,749
Cool!

206
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,229
Greymon!

207
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,311
Don't quit!

208
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,435
Sonic Destroyer!

209
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,840
Oh, no, Tai! He's hurt.

210
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,639
-There's nothing you can do.
-Greymon, get up!

211
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,518
Greymon, wake up. He's coming!

212
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,870
It worked on me.

213
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,798
Come on, Tai.

214
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,118
-Go for it!
-Nova Flame!

215
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,911
Greymon!

216
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,273
That night changed our lives.

217
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,749
It was a while before we realized
that those of us...

218
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,070
...who saw what happened
became the DigiDestined.

219
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,434
Greymon...

220
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,595
...don't you wanna play horsey
with me anymore?

221
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,991
Where are you?

222
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,198
It was even longer
before we found out that Willis met...

223
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,918
...his Digimon that same night.

224
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,355
He learned alone
that being a DigiDestined means...

225
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,476
...sometimes you gotta save the world...

226
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,630
...even if you're the one
who caused the problem.

227
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,678
It was another DigiDestined, Izzy,
who first noticed there was trouble.

228
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,270
Prodigious!
A computer virus on the lnternet.

229
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,554
Wait a minute.

230
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,278
It's attacking something.

231
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,717
Let me see if I can get an image
of its target.

232
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,914
Izzy wasn't the only one tracking the virus.
The whole world was watching.

233
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,151
But no one was prepared for
what was about to happen.

234
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,228
Looks like a DigiEgg.

235
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,998
Where'd that come from?

236
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,999
The virus is causing the egg
to develop abnormally fast.

237
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,036
I think it's gonna hatch.

238
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,039
Across town, Tai and another DigiDestined,
Sora, were facing their own problem.

239
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,156
"Dear Sora:
I'm sorry about what happened.

240
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,231
"l haven't felt so bad since I accidentally...

241
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,278
"...threw up in your hat
and didn't tell you before you wore it.

242
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,430
"l know our relationship
has been stormy lately.

243
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,751
"You love thundershowers,
what's a few raindrops between friends?

244
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,513
"Love, Tai."
"Love." I mean, "From." I mean....

245
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,357
Who are you writing to, Tai?

246
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,150
It's just an e-mail joke.
What are you doing in here anyway, Kari?

247
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,755
I wanted to show you my new dress.
I'm going to a birthday party.

248
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,592
I got my friend a pink Power Ranger.

249
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,591
Tai and I had a give-and-take relationship.

250
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,272
I would give and he would take.

251
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,588
-Who cares?
-To send...

252
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,955
...you have to click this. Click!

253
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,911
I wasn't gonna send that letter.

254
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,117
-Then what did you write it for?
-Go to your party.

255
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,634
I can't believe Sora's gonna read my letter.

256
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,438
Wait a minute, "Unable to deliver"?

257
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,755
I can't believe
she's not gonna read my letter.

258
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,594
You try to tell a girl you're sorry
and your computer shuts you down.

259
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,474
Surprise!

260
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,315
Mom? Can I make a complaint?

261
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,349
Kari's eating birthday cake right now,
and all we have is leftover tofu.

262
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,829
I can make you a cake, Tai.
Hand me an egg, please.

263
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,591
No.

264
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,717
I needed to use up the rest
of the wheat germ anyway.

265
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,758
You get the door and I'll start on that cake.

266
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,556
Izzy, you're all sweaty. What's wrong?

267
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,031
Well, it's about the egg.
The egg has already hatched.

268
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,031
Not that egg. A DigiEgg!

269
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,793
My Digimon analyzer
doesn't even recognize it.

270
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,553
Looks like a cross between a jellyfish
and a contact lens.

271
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,677
-It's part Digimon, part virus.
-A Digimon with a virus? So?

272
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,719
You kidding? If it stays on the lnternet
it could destroy technology as we know it.

273
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,870
If it just hatched,
how do you know this stuff?

274
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,111
This kid I met on the lnternet,
Willis, from Colorado, e-mailed me.

275
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,952
I don't know
where he gets his information.

276
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,190
He's smart though.
He's in elementary school...

277
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,238
...but he's already taking classes
at Colorado State.

278
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,276
So what? I'm in junior high school
and I take classes at junior high school.

279
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,112
Look! The jellyfish digivolved.

280
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,714
He's sending an e-mail.
It says: "I'm hungry! "

281
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,438
Am I supposed to call for pizza?

282
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,637
He's eating computer data.
When he's done in this buffet line...

283
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,154
...he's gonna look for a database
with more food.

284
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,437
More food? What does he expect to find?
A grocery store?

285
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,876
Okay, that's one box of chocolates.

286
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,673
Your total comes to 1,000,125--

287
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,398
Yeah, that's what it says.

288
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,631
That must be really good chocolate.
Paper or plastic?

289
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,879
In supermarkets all over,
computer systems are failing...

290
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,997
...causing congestion at the registers.
And now for the weather.

291
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,513
I made beef-jerky shakes.

292
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,035
-No, thanks, Mom.
-Where are you going?

293
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,310
We need to use Dad's computer.

294
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,436
Don't you want your shake?

295
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,596
-I'm glad someone appreciates my recipes.
-Thanks, Mrs. Kamiya.

296
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,752
-We gotta be careful with my dad's stuff.
-Get out of my way.

297
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,876
A Digimon is eating the lnternet
and you're worried about a few books!

298
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,030
But my dad likes his mess where it is.

299
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,157
We'll have more capabilities
by networking our computers together.

300
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,710
Why don't we just call up the Digimon
on the screen and hit "Delete"?

301
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,392
Don't you think I've tried that?

302
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,948
If this is dangerous,
maybe we should call someone...

303
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,873
-...Iike the principal or Bill Gates.
-They won't listen.

304
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,713
Willis warned his lnternet carrier
about the new Digimon.

305
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,031
They said, "Great! Let's sign him up
and give him 50 free hours."

306
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,998
-All right, we're online.
-He's digivolved again.

307
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,638
My name is Keramon.

308
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,759
-I think he's at the Rookie level.
-This soon? He's digivolving too quickly!

309
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,274
-He's probably at a fast food web site.
-Now what?

310
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,110
Nothing.

311
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,679
We have to watch it eat...

312
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,909
...the world out of house and homepage?

313
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,197
I wish Agumon was here to help us.

314
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,158
I can almost hear him now.

315
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,998
You can hear me now.

316
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,593
It's like he was here.

317
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,829
I am here.

318
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,753
Agumon, where are you?
I can barely hear you.

319
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,593
-Take me off speakerphone.
-It's a transmission...

320
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,598
...from the Digital World.

321
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,279
-Agumon!
-And he's with Gennai.

322
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,670
-It's been a long time.
-Don't forget me.

323
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,875
Tentomon!

324
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,915
Who else is there?

325
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,955
-Biyomon.
-Pabumon.

326
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,314
-Palmon.
-Patamon.

327
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,072
-Gomamon.
-Gatomon.

328
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,870
We need to talk.
Something's threatening the Internet.

329
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,191
We know. The Digimon's already causing
major problems in our world.

330
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,999
-I'm not sure it is a Digimon.
-But it is dangerous.

331
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,277
The evil Dark Masters were cupcakes
compared to this guy.

332
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,191
That's it, then. Let's do it!

333
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,350
We found a way to enter the Internet.

334
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,876
We'll help you guys because
you're the best friends we've ever had.

335
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,952
What better way to express friendship
than to save your world.

336
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,790
Tentomon.

337
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,393
Don't get so emotional.

338
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,598
Thanks a lot, guys. You won't be alone.
We'll be right here on the computer.

339
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,309
-lzzy, Digivice?
-I'm one step ahead of you, Tai.

340
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,479
Our Digivices will help you digivolve
and together we'll squash that bug.

341
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,672
It'll take a minute for Agumon
and Tentomon to get on the Net.

342
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,193
My modem 's older than I am.

343
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,431
I'll call the other DigiDestineds
so their Digimon can help, too.

344
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,669
Hi, this is Tai Kamiya.

345
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,194
Can I speak to Joe, please? A test?

346
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,269
He's the only kid I know
who volunteers for summer school.

347
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,837
Hi, is Matt or T.K. there?

348
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,230
They're visiting their grandmother
in the country?

349
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,440
Hey, Tai. Any luck yet?

350
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,750
Would you like a glass
of potato juice, lzzy?

351
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,671
Great! I'd love some.

352
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,159
Be there, be there.... Hello there!

353
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,435
This is Tai.

354
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,839
You're selling ties?

355
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,037
No, my name is Tai.
I'm looking for Matt or T.K.

356
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,078
That's a coincidence.
Those are my grandkids' names.

357
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,752
That's great. Are they there?

358
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,115
Right now? Can I talk to them?

359
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,512
I love to talk to them, too.
They're here visiting me.

360
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,830
Please, I need to speak to them right away.

361
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,434
Okay, I'll tell them. Kids!

362
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,272
I can't take this!

363
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,397
You know, lzzy, I can never get Tai
to try any of my recipes.

364
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,358
-I think they taste great.
-Want to try my spinach cookies?

365
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,589
I got Mimi's machine.

366
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,116
Hi, it's Mimi. I'm so glad you called.
Let's get together for lunch.

367
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,839
Leave a very short message after the beep.

368
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,069
Mimi, I--

369
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,559
That girl loves to talk.

370
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,029
You're a natural in the kitchen,
just like me.

371
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,156
Mom, I need to get a hold of Kari,
right away.

372
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,912
Did she take your cell phone with her?

373
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,319
Do I have enough of this stuff?

374
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,278
Beats me, it's the first time
I've used flour to bake a cake.

375
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,756
Of course she's got it,
in case of emergency.

376
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,957
Emergency. What does she think this is?

377
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,189
Happy birthday!

378
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,271
-Make a wish.
-Blow them out.

379
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,277
-Call them back.
-I can't come home.

380
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,558
A magician's coming over later
and I volunteered to be sawed in half.

381
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,276
Whatever. Just tell the half with feet
to run home soon.

382
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,751
I can't get anybody on the phone.

383
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,552
I want you to call Sora for me.

384
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,996
But you and she are good friends.
It makes more sense for you to call.

385
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,513
Just do it!

386
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,834
Are more friends coming?
I'll make three-bean salad.

387
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,831
Nobody's coming over, Mom.

388
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,076
That's all right.
I only have two beans, anyway.

389
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,559
Sorry, Sora's not home.

390
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,473
I'll tell her to call Tai's house
as soon as she gets back.

391
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,313
Hold on, she just walked in.
I'll put her right on.

392
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,039
-Sora, I think Tai wants to speak to you.
-I'm not home.

393
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,519
I already said you're here.

394
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,068
Make something up.
I don't care what you tell him.

395
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,991
But, Sora l--

396
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,310
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.
Goodbye.

397
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,391
Sora said she's not home.

398
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,994
-Did you two have an argument?
-None of your business!

399
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,878
You must've been a jerk
if she doesn't want to talk to you.

400
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,428
-I didn't do anything!
-I meant that in a good way.

401
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,796
I can't believe she's still mad.
It all started over a hair clip.

402
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,233
He'd better have written me.

403
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,118
Greetings. You have no new mail. Okay?

404
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,158
No, it's not okay. Stupid Tai!

405
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,994
Thank you for visiting meow.com.

406
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,870
Miko, get down from there.

407
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,034
Agumon and Tentomon
should be on the lnternet by now.

408
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,749
Does this information superhighway
have a rest stop? I've got to go potty.

409
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,798
You should've gone before we left.
Just hold it!

410
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,393
You're gonna need a password.

411
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,994
You can use mine to get on the Internet:
Prodigious.

412
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,559
-Prodigious.
-They're in!

413
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,677
So this is what the lnternet looks like.
They need new wallpaper.

414
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,149
I hope this doesn't take long,
it's my bath night.

415
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,673
There he is, go get him!

416
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,718
He doesn't know we're here.
Let's sneak up on him quietly.

417
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,074
Super Shocker!

418
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,948
That's quietly?

419
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,951
Pepper Breath!

420
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,955
That should have worked, but it didn't.

421
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,272
Keramon's sending us an e-mail. It says:

422
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,797
"So, you like to play games?"
I got a bad feeling about this, Agumon.

423
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,269
You better digivolve. Both of you. Now!

424
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,512
Agumon, digivolve to....

425
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,636
Tentomon, digivolve to....

426
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,438
-Greymon.
-Kabuterimon.

427
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,519
Bug Buster!

428
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,072
Electro Shocker!

429
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,679
Nova Blast!

430
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,238
You guys make this stuff look easy.

431
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,548
Hold that thought!

432
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,551
Keramon, digivolve to....

433
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,755
Infermon.

434
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,390
-No way, he's digivolved again.
-We've never seen this before.

435
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,911
Now he's at the Champion level,
like Greymon and Kabuterimon.

436
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,595
-Electro Shocker!
-Nova Blast!

437
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,995
-Yeah!
-All right!

438
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,272
He's stronger than a Champion.

439
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,237
Spider Shooter!

440
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,193
Kabuterimon!

441
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,878
-Greymon, no!
-I think I've got it figured out now.

442
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,909
He's bypassed the Champion level
and digivolved into the Ultimate level.

443
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,877
He's too strong for our Digimon now.

444
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,269
Then they're just gonna have
to digivolve again.

445
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,437
Not so fast.

446
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,391
Greymon, digivolve to....

447
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,630
MetalGreymon!

448
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,831
He's gotta digivolve faster.

449
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,557
Agumon, say something!

450
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,119
Don't take me out, coach.

451
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,230
Tentomon?

452
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,629
I'm fine. Just one question:
Who's Tentomon?

453
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,872
They'll be okay, Tai.
They just need to rest for a while.

454
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,270
I can't believe that two Digimon
at the Champion level weren't enough.

455
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,396
We'll never be able to defeat this thing.

456
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,278
Check this out. We're getting e-mails
from around the world.

457
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,032
Here's one from Willis in America.

458
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,908
It says, "lzzy, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
Find a way to slow him down."

459
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,116
-What's he mean, "his fault"?
-I don't know.

460
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,316
Infermon is e-mailing us, too.

461
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,153
Why is he saying "hello"
over and over again?

462
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,434
Look at the address.

463
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,318
He's at the telephone company
taking over the phone lines.

464
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,709
If we lose our phone connection,
we're finished.

465
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,268
That's the only way
we have access to the lnternet.

466
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,516
I've got to warn everyone.

467
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,915
All circuits are busy. Try again later.

468
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,195
Oh, great. It's busy. Mimi!

469
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,908
-All circuits are busy. Try again later.
-Come on! How could that be busy too?

470
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,271
-All circuits are still busy.
-Don't tell me!

471
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,431
-Didn't you hear me? It's busy!
-I'm sorry, lady.

472
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,153
All the phones are dead.

473
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,999
-That Digimon did it.
-Not a single call can get through.

474
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,275
Hello, this is Tai.

475
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,874
Hello. Did you program me?

476
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,791
It's lnfermon.

477
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,191
Hello?

478
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,478
Talk about speed dialing!

479
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,838
Infermon was looking for someone.
He was calling every number in the world.

480
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,275
His long-distance bill will be enormous.

481
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,271
What?

482
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,675
"Connection terminated."

483
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,911
What next?

484
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,796
Kids, cake's almost ready.

485
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,998
Phones have gone dead worldwide.

486
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,640
If your telephone is dead,
call your phone company.

487
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,188
At least my sister can't call me
three times a day.

488
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,157
-See you!
-Are you leaving so soon?

489
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,357
Don't worry, I'll be back.
Save me a piece of cake.

490
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,518
What's the matter with you?

491
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,038
Have you heard? The phones are out.

492
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,793
The stock market is in chaos
and people are rioting.

493
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,949
That's nice.

494
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,673
Tai says call,
then he won't get off the phone.

495
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,797
We interrupt this programming
for a special bulletin.

496
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,754
Goody, I bet it's one
of those high-speed chases.

497
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,593
The phone company has set up
an emergency voice-mail system.

498
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,353
Simply dial 171 for easy instructions.

499
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,358
Believe me, it wasn't so easy.

500
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,477
First you had to leave a message,
then call back to hear one.

501
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,312
Basically, it was playing phone tag.

502
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,072

Please leave your message at the tone.

505
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,074
Matt, T.K., this is an emergency.
Call me right away! By the way, it's Tai.

506
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,269
Kari, if you want to see your toys again,
get home right away!

507
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,952
Sora, listen, I'm sorry about the hairpin.
But I need to talk to you right away.

508
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,519
Call me. Or just come over.

509
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,879
Stupid Tai.

510
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,433
Mimi, it's Tai. Please come to my house
as soon as you get this message. 'Bye.

511
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,198
That reminds me.

512
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,669
You got this postcard
in the mail from Mimi.

513
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,749
What?

514
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,030
She's on vacation? In Hawaii?

515
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,679
Hawaii is paradise.

516
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,072
I don't have a care in the world.
I'm wishing you were here.

517
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,516
-Hi, lzzy. Welcome back.
-Thank you.

518
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,671
So, when's everybody coming over?

519
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,348
Cheer up already.

520
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,635
What happened to the days
when we were a team?

521
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,712
We are a team, Tai,
but we're just kind of spread out right now.

522
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,711
By the way, where did you disappear to?

523
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,190
-Well, I went to pick this up.
-What is it?

524
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,508
A satellite uplink.

525
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,713
We can get onto the lnternet by tapping
into the military's satellite system.

526
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,631
You're a genius. How does it work?

527
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,358
Do you know what a semiconductor is?

528
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,078
One who works part-time on a train?

529
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,990
Never mind!

530
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,593
-ls it hooked up yet?
-Almost.

531
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,957
In the meantime, check the messages
to see if anyone called back.

532
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,269
I forgot.

533
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,032
You have one new message.

534
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,873
Tai, it's Matt. What's the big emergency?
Call me back.

535
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,033
I gotta go.
Grandma fell asleep on T.K. again.

536
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,910
Good old Matt.

537
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,594
I knew that somebody on the team
would come through.

538
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,877
Matt, did you and T.K.
bring your Digivices with you?

539
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,389
Did you pack them?

540
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,713
This is T.K., of course we have them.
What's going on?

541
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,476
An evil Digimon
has taken over the Internet.

542
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,199
Agumon and Tentomon are fighting it,
but they need help.

543
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,840
Get your Digivices to a computer
as fast as you can.

544
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,273
What do we do now?

545
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,557
The closest thing our grandmother has
to a computer is an egg timer.

546
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,358
We're going into town to find one.

547
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,476
The uplink's working. We're back online.

548
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,755
Now let's exterminate that bug.

549
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,148
He left the phone company.
Now where is he?

550
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,353
He sent another e-mail.
"I'm close to him"? Close to who?

551
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,833
-He's in America.
-He doesn't even have a green card.

552
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,674
-I said slow down!
-I can't hear you!

553
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,479
The Digimon's in New York.

554
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,439
He's eaten all the data at Kennedy Airport
and is headed for the subway system.

555
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,590
Good, that'll slow him down for sure.

556
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,911
I'll e-mail Willis and let him know
that lnfermon is heading his way.

557
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,274
I do have one question though:

558
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,989
What do you think that Digimon would
be like if the virus never attacked him?

559
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,514
I have one too:
Why are you still drinking that junk?

560
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,478
Just 'cause you don't eat healthy,
doesn't mean that I don't.

561
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,551
Don't say I didn't warn you.

562
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,072
-We've got the Digivices.
-Now what?

563
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,675
Awesome! We'll tell Gennai to upload
Gabumon and Patamon onto the Net.

564
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,829
You can do that?

565
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,188
That sounds like fun.

566
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,831
-Usually I just play Solitaire on that thing.
-Careful, Floyd, you almost cut my ear off.

567
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,831
Kids today are so smart, aren't they?

568
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,639
I still can't set the time on my VCR.

569
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,075
Matt, who are all those weird people?

570
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,390
They're not weird. They're my best friends.

571
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,875
Considering this is
the only computer in town.

572
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,838
Gennai's transfer of the Digimon
is almost completed.

573
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,195
Can I have yours?

574
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,350
You're the bravest kid I have ever known.

575
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,634
We're going back in.

576
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,757
I assume lzzy and Tai were unsuccessful
in finding anyone else.

577
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,832
Then you and I'll have to try to beat
that thing by ourselves.

578
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,549
-Sorry we're late.
-I was surfing the Net and I wiped out.

579
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,798
Gabumon and Patamon!

580
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,759
-ls T.K. on this ride?
-He's not tall enough.

581
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,314
Gabumon!

582
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,589
Patamon!

583
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,030
Say hello later. We've got work to do.

584
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,799
Keep your legs and wings
inside the ride at all times.

585
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,629
Just a little further, guys. Remember,
he's dangerous, so stay focused.

586
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,839
I'm looking for the programmer.
Don't interfere!

587
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,229
-He's teasing us.
-Then let's get him.

588
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,271
It's time to digivolve.

589
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,359
-Gabumon, warp digivolve to....
-Agumon, warp digivolve to....

590
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,474
WarGreymon.

591
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,839
MetalGarurumon.

592
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,269
-All right!
-Patamon, you better digivolve.

593
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,190
Patamon, digivolve to....

594
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,272
Infermon, digivolve to....

595
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,879
Diaboromon.

596
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,309
-What's going on?
-He digivolved.

597
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,311
Cable Crusher!

598
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,278
Look out, Patamon!

599
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,479
I'll save him.

600
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,278
-Patamon, are you all right?
-Tentomon!

601
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,032
I'm fine. What about Patamon?

602
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,632
Patamon, speak to me!
Come on, get up! Say something!

603
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,598
-I'm coming! I'll come get you!
-You can't.

604
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,239
But you can.

605
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,633
Wipe him out!

606
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,278
Ice Wolf Spikes!

607
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,719
Web Wrecker!

608
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,278
Tentomon, circle around!
WarGreymon, attack!

609
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,149
-It's no use.
-What are you saying? We're winning.

610
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,028
-This could be it.
-Great.

611
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,350
Not that!

612
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,954
-What's going on?
-There's something wrong with me.

613
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,077
-What is it?
-I think it's your mother's recipes.

614
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,998
I hate to tell you I told you so,
but, I told you so!

615
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,193
Look, something's wrong.

616
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,436
Oh, no, they're slowing down.

617
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,068
Come on!

618
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,472
Tai, where'd you go?

619
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,596
WarGreymon has practically
stopped moving.

620
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,593
Oh, no!

621
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,516
-I feel a lot better.
-I didn't touch anything, I swear!

622
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,475
-Tai, what did you do?
-lt wasn't my fault.

623
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,518
Who told you to go to the bathroom
at such an important time?

624
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,749
Like I had a choice!

625
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,434
Why did you crash the computer?
Now it has to reboot.

626
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,832
-It's not like I did it on purpose.
-Just like it wasn't your fault with Sora.

627
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,514
That wasn't my fault.

628
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,716
Okay, maybe it was my fault.

629
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,994
What happened?

630
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,310
I gave her this great hairpin
for her birthday.

631
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,153
Then she got mad and said,
"You don't like my hair style?"

632
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,515
I said "Who could tell?
You always wear a hat. "

633
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,354
Then she said, "Now you hate my hat?"
It's very confusing.

634
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,432
That's what you fought about?

635
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,830
I tried to apologize,
but she won't return my phone calls.

636
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,072
We're back online.

637
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,353
WarGreymon!

638
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,191
Where were you?

639
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,352
You two picked a lousy time
to take a lunch break!

640
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,159
What happened to him? WarGreymon!

641
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,792
Tai, I can't move!

642
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,475
I let him down. I should have been there.

643
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,915
-"Your Digimon's a loser."
-What did you say?

644
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,629
"How could two Mega-level Digimon
get beat by one lousy bug?

645
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,392
"WarGreymon quit like a coward."

646
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,471
You take that back or I'll--

647
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,989
I was reading an e-mail from another kid.

648
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,435
You didn't have to read it so well.

649
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,309
You two, this isn't the time for fighting.

650
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,313
Stupid e-mails!

651
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,397
Go back to the beginning.

652
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,719
Diaboromon's back! Another e-mail?

653
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,951
"Who can count backwards from ten?"

654
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,270
Is he giving us a math test?

655
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,710
What's that?

656
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,076
What's with the timer?

657
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,395
He's making copies of himself.

658
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,239
He's multiplying.

659
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,875
It gets worse! The USA just launched
two nuclear missiles.

660
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,030
Willis says the government
can't explain it...

661
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,759
...but he knows Diaboromon's
in the Pentagon's computers.

662
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,513
I hope I didn't lead him there
with my satellite uplink.

663
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,636
One of the missiles is headed for Colorado.

664
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,316
-They'll land in less than ten minutes.
-That explains the timer.

665
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,674
But what's in Colorado?

666
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,752
I have no idea. In the meantime,
Diaboromon keeps multiplying.

667
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,678
The military has the power to stop it.

668
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,479
Every country is trying to intercept them,
including Japan.

669
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,949
But Diaboromon
has infiltrated all their computers...

670
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,713
...and is rerouting them
to fall in the ocean near Hawaii.

671
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,835
Fireworks!

672
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,637
I've got the trajectory for the other missile.
Let me calculate it.

673
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,392
Four carry the two, times three....

674
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,516
It's aimed right for this neighborhood.

675
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,551
Look, e-mails from around the world:

676
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,949
"Get that evil Digimon.
You're our only hope."

677
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,237
Here's another: "Be home by 6:00."
Wait. That's from my mom.

678
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,039
I'm trying to save the world
and you're reading fan mail.

679
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,872
-We just lost our connection.
-Great!

680
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,033
I'll get it back. If we defeat the original
Diaboromon, the rest will disappear.

681
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:57,791
What?

682
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,997
All we have to do is destroy each one,
until we find the original.

683
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,196
Sounds great. How many are there so far?

684
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,909
Spit it out, lzzy. How many are there?

685
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,430
There are over 75,000 and counting!

686
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,910
What's that?
It didn't sound like my stomach.

687
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:21,471
-Tai! Have faith! I'll find the original.
-WarGreymon!

688
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,197
I'll help you.

689
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,508
MetalGarurumon.

690
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,192
They're so slow.

691
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,072
It's because of all the e-mails.

692
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,720
They're slowing down
our Digimon processing speed.

693
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,713
I'll write to everyone to stop them
e-mailing till the Digimon are strong again.

694
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,674
Are you crazy? Do you know
how long that'll take? There's no time.

695
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,075
Now we're...

696
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,515
...just about...

697
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,478
-...finished.
-lt can't end like this.

698
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,797
Tell me, will they make it?

699
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,993
I'm not sure.

700
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,793
But they're gonna try.

701
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,279
Don't give up! No matter what happens,
don't give up!

702
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,950
Don't interfere!

703
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,995
How many copies of Diaboromon
are there now?

704
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,789
To be honest, I don't know.
I stopped keeping track a while ago.

705
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,757
It's got to be well over a million.

706
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,719
MetalGarurumon!

707
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,230
WarGreymon has started
to slow down again.

708
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,880
It's the e-mails.
They're coming in faster than ever.

709
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,474
They're slowing down
the processing speed even more.

710
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,391
They're sitting ducks out there.

711
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,758
Please, guys, stop writing!

712
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,798
I know your intentions are good,
but you're hurting our cause.

713
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,269
Your e-mails are putting
our Digimon in danger.

714
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,752
I've got to help.

715
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,274
There must be a way....

716
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,909
Somehow.

717
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,870
More juice, lzzy?
I just squeezed some onions.

718
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,909
No, thanks, I'm rerouting incoming data
from the remote server into local memory.

719
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,517
I'll just leave you two alone.

720
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,950
Wait a minute, where did Tai go?

721
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:30,238
None of us are sure how, but Tai's bond
with WarGreymon was so strong...

722
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,436
... Tai, himself, became digital.

723
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,552
WarGreymon, I'm here.

724
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,955
MetalGarurumon!

725
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,990
Wake up! Don't quit now!

726
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,157
-Why won't he answer me, Tai?
-Keep trying, Matt.

727
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,953
Listen, I don't have a whistle to wake you.
But I want you to know you're not alone.

728
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,719
The mail keeps coming. It won't stop.

729
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,394
Kids from all over the world are writing
to you.

730
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,597
They need your help.
You're the only one who can do it.

731
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,320
Feel their hope. Feel their strength.

732
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,512
I feel them.

733
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,757
Where'd your brother go?

734
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,319
They combined.

735
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,798
Part WarGreymon.

736
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,199
Part MetalGarurumon.

737
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,191
They digivolved together to become....

738
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,673
Omnimon.

739
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,274
Transcendent Sword!

740
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,949
Hurry!

741
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,551
Supreme Cannon!

742
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,032
Tai, there's the original. Get him!
We're running out of time!

743
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,111
Omnimon! Quick, attack!

744
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,359
Where is he?

745
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,758
One minute to go.

746
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,555
One minute to go.

747
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,868
One minute to go.

748
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,997
Squad leader to Command,
we were unable to destroy the target.

749
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,197
The missile will impact.
Repeat: The missile will impact.

750
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,394
He keeps moving.

751
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,074
Every time he's in our sights,
he jumps somewhere else.

752
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,957
He's too fast for us.

753
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,797
We have the power to destroy him now,
but we don't have the time.

754
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,350
Willis was right, we have to find
some way to slow down Diaboromon.

755
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,999
Thirty seconds left.

756
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,235
The e-mails!

757
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,108
If I forward him all the e-mails,
it'll slow him down, just like it did to us.

758
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,519
Keep sending them, kids.

759
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,710
You've got mail.

760
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,869
Ten seconds left.

761
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,949
Nine...

762
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:24,870
...eight...

763
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,790
...seven...

764
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:26,630
...six...

765
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,596
...five...

766
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,510
...four...

767
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,430
...three...

768
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,635
...two...

769
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,709
...one.

770
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,995
Connection terminated.

771
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,036
Willis!

772
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,393
Lousy microwave!

773
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,438
How come every electronic appliance
has to have a bug in it?

774
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,034
Greetings.
You have one new piece of mail.

775
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,829
It's about time.

776
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,434
"Dear Sora: I'm sorry.... Threw up hat....

777
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,318
"What's a few raindrops between friends?
Love, Tai."

778
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,593
Stupid Tai!

779
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,837
I'm about to barf.

780
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,953
Wait till you try the cake.

781
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,035
When Willis saw what happened
on the Internet...

782
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,634
...he was as happy as the rest of us.

783
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,519
So were the twins,
Terriermon and Kokomon.

784
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,670
They figured that would be the end of it.

785
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,432
But they were wrong.

786
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,871
It was just the beginning.

787
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,988
Kokomon!

788
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,114
Willis was about to face
the Digibattle of his life.

789
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,037
But he was all alone.

790
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,191
These days the team is older,
but some things never change.

791
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,478
Tai's still obsessed with soccer,
and Sora 's still waiting for him to call.

792
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,634
Izzy's idea of a fun night
is upgrading his computer...

793
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,950
...and Matt's trying to make it
as a rock star.

794
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,952
His stage name is: "The DigiDestined
formerly known as Matt. "

795
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,191
Even though the older kids
don't have much time for the DigiWorld...

796
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,999
...there are new DigiDestined kids
to pick up the slack.

797
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,868
That's Cody, a real sensitive little kid,
and that's his Digimon: Upamon.

798
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,039
Yolei and Poromon can match wits
with the best of them...

799
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,394
...as well as tan lines.

800
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,314
And there's Davis and DemiVeemon.
I know, Davis looks like my brother Tai.

801
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,829
They even have the same personality:
obnoxious.

802
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,195
While they were having
a good time at the beach...

803
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,872
...I was in New York with T.K...

804
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,952
...partly to visit Mimi
and partly to make Davis jealous.

805
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,429
Smile!

806
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,439
Not again.

807
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,553
-lt didn't go through?
-No.

808
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,358
What's wrong with it?

809
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:55,434
I don't know. It says all lines are busy.
There must be an electrical surge.

810
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,956
What do you think we should do now, T.K.?

811
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,868
How about lunch?

812
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,833
Did you guys hear that?

813
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,228
Did we hear what?

814
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,232
I'm getting a feeling
there's something strange out there...

815
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,390
...but I'm not sure what it is.

816
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,671
It needs our help though.

817
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,429
I hate it when I'm right.

818
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,228
It turned out that the person
who needed our help was Willis.

819
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,911
Kokomon, this has to stop!

820
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,228
Go back!

821
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,510
What do you mean "back"? Back to what?

822
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,028
Destroy!

823
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,515
No!

824
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,593
Terriermon!

825
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,799
Bunny Blast!

826
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,473
Koko Krusher!

827
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,359
Bunny Blast!

828
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,792
Terriermon!

829
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,115
Hurry, T.K. It's over this way.

830
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,679
Kokomon, stop!

831
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,033
A Digimon!

832
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,276
I'm not sure it is a Digimon.

833
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,714
All right, tell me, what do you want?

834
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,792
Go back.

835
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,039
He vanished.

836
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,394
Hey, kid.

837
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,955
Come here.

838
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,076
Don't follow me! You're in danger!

839
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,197
Leave it to me.
I'll find out where he's going.

840
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,274
-What does he mean, "we're in danger"?
-All I know is he needs help.

841
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,872
Hi, Mom. Our summer camp
is going backpacking in Colorado.

842
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,269
-We're leaving--
-Please deposit $2 for....

843
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,635
I'll call you when I get there.

844
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,876
Come on, Terriermon.
We have to find transportation.

845
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,594
I can't keep running from him.
We're going back.

846
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,477
Colorado? Why there?

847
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,758
I'm sending an e-mail to Davis
and the others.

848
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,595
I told him to meet up with us.

849
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,672
We could really use their help,
and I'm sure he misses me.

850
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,715
The D-Terminal!
"Found new kid with Digimon"?

851
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,593
Yeah, a new friend.

852
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,478
She wants us to meet them in Colorado.

853
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,712
Well, how does she expect us
to get to America?

854
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,358
We don't have the money.

855
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,034
Willis, do we have to go to Colorado?

856
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:23,669
You heard what Kokomon said.
"Go back." That's where it all started.

857
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,557
But why do we have to walk?

858
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,200
My soles are worn out
and I don't even wear shoes.

859
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,952
Terriermon, listen. We--

860
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:37,159
Come on, Willis, can't we just call
for someone to give us a ride?

861
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,518
I'm sorry. You know
Kokomon's getting more violent.

862
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,558
He makes anyone close to us disappear.
I'll find us a ride.

863
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:47,394
-Let's get out of this sun. It's too hot.
-Wait!

864
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,076
What exactly do you think you're doing?

865
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:56,994
This way I don't have to walk,
and you can stay in the shade.

866
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,149
That's better.

867
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,550
I don't suppose you could turn into
a glass of lemonade, could you?

868
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,952
Look, my Digivice.

869
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,710
What's happening to the train?

870
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,794
I don't think this is
the entertainment portion of the trip.

871
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,834
It's that Digimon we saw in New York.

872
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,877
Don't interfere!

873
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,672
There's definitely something different
about this Digimon.

874
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,354
We're not moving. Where are we?

875
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,348
Don't interfere?

876
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,908
I don't think that Digimon
wants us in Colorado.

877
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,629
Explain one more time why we have
to stop in three different cities?

878
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,518
We're using my uncle's flyer miles
and restrictions apply.

879
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,633
Why did we have to take
this particular taxi company?

880
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,030
I've an uncle who lives in Houston.
He has an account with them.

881
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,839
-It's not really that bad.
-At least it's free.

882
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,115
What do you say, guys,
wanna hear some music?

883
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,189
Sure, why not?

884
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,475
We prefer something
on the slow and easy side.

885
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,595
Sure.

886
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,718
I'm pretty good.

887
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,518
'Bye, Uncle Fred.
Thanks for the lift. Goodbye.

888
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,351
Yolei, your uncle's a lousy pilot.

889
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,671
On the map, we're abut 60 miles
from where we're meeting Kari.

890
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,797
-How do we get there?
-I have an uncle who owns some horses.

891
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,316
No! No more uncles,
no more horses, no trains, no planes.

892
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,038
It's got to stop!

893
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,072
Did someone say stop?

894
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,989
Come on, guys, this is our chance.

895
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,080
Well, at least my way
we weren't stowaways.

896
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,958
-Climb in. It's perfect.
-Let me handle this.

897
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,635
Yeah, ma'am, I said stop. I'm starting
my own truck stop and was testing it.

898
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,950
It seems to work fine.
You stopped. Thanks.

899
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,270
-Let's go.
-Come on.

900
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,957
Hey, pal, you must've had
the same idea we did.

901
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,228
Hey, would you cut that out? That's rude.

902
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,193
Sorry about that. He's young.

903
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,558
Davis, guess what? He's a Digimon.

904
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,834
A what?

905
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,992
Hey, he's right.

906
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,436
Wow! In America,
they have Digimon by the truck load.

907
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,596
Our Digimon like each other.

908
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,558
And the guy says,
"l was talking to the duck."

909
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,792
This is kind of nice,
being around others for a change.

910
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:59,156
Yeah, for as long as I can remember,
it's just been me and Willis.

911
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,595
Having a Digimon
makes you a DigiDestined...

912
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,592
...and we're all part of a team.
Why are you alone?

913
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,955
Well, let's just say I have my reasons.

914
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,032
Anyway, it's nice meeting someone
as cute as you.

915
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,633
Back off there, blondie.

916
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,836
What's wrong, Davis?
Did I say something wrong?

917
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,831
We found this kid. Now what do we do?

918
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,718
He's angry because he wanted
to be with Kari by now.

919
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,315
My family's vacation home is just
a couple of towns away from here.

920
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,517
You guys can wait for them there
if you want to.

921
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,111
I'd better e-mail Kari and T.K.
to tell them where to meet us.

922
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,277
-Where are they coming from?
-From New York.

923
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:36,989
The kids behind the fence.
That girl was cute, too.

924
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,117
That's it, lover-boy. Leave Kari out of this.

925
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,919
I'm sorry.

926
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,673
Listen, Davis,
I wasn't trying to step on anybody's toes.

927
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,389
Maybe I should just make a phone call
and get us a lift to my house.

928
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,631
I'd like a pizza for delivery
with mushrooms, sausage, pepperoni...

929
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,598
...pineapple, Canadian bacon, anchovies,
and green peppers.

930
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,638
That sounds delicious,
but aren't you going to have anything?

931
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,711
If Davis eats it all....

932
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,349
-There's no fat below my neck.
-Since you're delivering that pizza...

933
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,238
...to my house, would you mind
picking us up on the way?

934
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,551
-Tell him to forget it. I want Chinese.
-Shut up!

935
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,868
I said, "Line up."

936
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,555
We'll line up on the side of the road
with a sign, so we're easy to spot.

937
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,996
-You've done this before.
-They'll be here in two minutes or it's free.

938
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,833
-Willis, you're smart.
-Well, it was mostly my idea.

939
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,434
Great, then you're buying the pizza!

940
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,876
-Pizza!
-Guys, come on, let's go!

941
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:33,470
-Why do I have to be the one paying for it?
-It's your pie. You buy.

942
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,597
Don't open your big mouth
unless it's to eat pizza.

943
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:40,468
If I'm paying for it, I get the first half.
And I get the second half, too.

944
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,236
Now that that's settled,
I guess we're ready to go.

945
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,033
We'll tell you how the pizza tasted.

946
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,990
If that driver thinks he's getting a tip,
forget it!

947
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,033
What is it?

948
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,589
Davis!

949
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,588
Destroy!

950
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,028
Kokomon.

951
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,231
You know this Digimon?

952
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,670
DemiVeemon, quick, digivolve!

953
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,831
DemiVeemon, digivolve to....

954
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,394
Veemon!

955
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,719
Vee Head Butt!

956
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,350
How about a little teamwork?

957
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,679
Pick me up. We'll attack him from the air.

958
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,398
All right, we've got you!

959
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,436
Watch out for that sign.

960
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,955
Time for plan B.

961
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,115
Veemon, armor digivolve to....

962
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,830
Flamedramon, the Fire of Courage!

963
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,312
Flamedramon, attack!

964
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,839
Fire Rocket!

965
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,752
One small detail.

966
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,753
Who is that? And why is he attacking us?

967
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,633
Cable Crusher!

968
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,879
Koko Krusher!

969
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,513
Kokomon, I'm doing what you want.

970
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,589
I'm going back.

971
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,672
Go back...

972
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,515
...to the beginning!

973
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,876
Willis, use your Digivice.

974
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,794
I feel strange.

975
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,116
Terriermon, digivolve to....

976
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,319
Gargomon!

977
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,678
He's got pants now.

978
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,193
Bunny Bubble!

979
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,591
Gargo Pellets!

980
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,238
Go back.

981
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,314
-What for?
-Go back.

982
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,548
He put up a good fight, but we won.

983
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:32,671
We didn't win anything.

984
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,714
He won't stop
until I give him what he wants.

985
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,950
What does he want? Maybe I can help.

986
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,235
Don't ask questions.
It's for your own good.

987
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:43,437
-The less you know the better.
-Willis, wait.

988
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,478
We're a team now.

989
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,349
It's okay to tell them the truth.

990
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,117
Well, the truth is,
we don't have a ride anymore.

991
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,631
No problem. I can handle that.

992
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,593
Veemon, armor digivolve to....

993
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:16,278
Raidramon! The Storm of Friendship!

994
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,872
-Did somebody call for a ride?
-That's cool.

995
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,428
Couldn't you have done that before?

996
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,031
Can we get a ride, too?

997
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,996
Sorry, we're on a mission.

998
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,679
-It's a big gust of wind.
-No, it's Davis.

999
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,352
Same difference.

1000
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,112
How do you stop this thing?

1001
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:00,913
So, this Kokomon attacked you?
I knew we shouldn't have split up.

1002
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,468
Where are your friends T.K. and Kari?

1003
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,190
They're still not here yet.

1004
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:09,318
What? What do you mean,
Kari's not here yet?

1005
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,755
Good question.
They really should have been here by now.

1006
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:17,398
If I know Kokomon,
your friends aren't coming at all.

1007
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,993
That's it, pal.

1008
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,913
Enough secrets.

1009
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,873
You seem to know a lot
about this monster.

1010
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,076
Spill it. How do you two know each other?

1011
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,799
And more importantly:
Why is he only attacking you?

1012
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:33,791
Because I created him.

1013
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,152
You must be kidding.

1014
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,828
You just can't create a Digimon
out of thin air.

1015
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,512
I've told you too much already.

1016
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,194
Kokomon makes everyone
who tries to help me disappear...

1017
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,840
...Iike I'll bet he did
to your friends T.K. and Kari.

1018
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,114
Willis.

1019
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,589
I have to do this by myself.
I need to be alone.

1020
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,318
Great, I'll go with you.

1021
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:00,275
Willis, we've been walking for hours
and you haven't said a word.

1022
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:04,273
Being a DigiDestined means
you don't have to face things alone.

1023
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,435
What are you running away from?

1024
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:11,438
Eight years ago,
a DigiEgg came out of my computer...

1025
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,431
...and it hatched into twin Digimon:

1026
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,112
Terriermon and Kokomon.

1027
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,034
I finally had someone to play with.
My very own pets, and they talked, too!

1028
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,439
It was the best.

1029
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,916
They depended on me.

1030
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,639
You have to give it time to heal, okay?

1031
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,115
Sometimes they would even do
my chores for me.

1032
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,713
I wanted more of them...

1033
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:34,236
...so I got the stupid idea
of creating a DigiEgg on the computer.

1034
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,436
That's when it all went bad.

1035
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,159
Before my DigiEgg hatched,
it was attacked by a virus...

1036
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,071
...and it mutated into Diaboromon.

1037
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,796
When Tai and the others destroyed him,
I thought my bad dream was over.

1038
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,950
But the real nightmare was just beginning.

1039
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,077
The virus tracked us down
and dragged Kokomon away from me.

1040
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,914
I watched helplessly for four years
as he slowly became this terrible monster.

1041
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,108
And now he's obsessed with chasing me.

1042
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:04,511
During the battle he said to you,
"Go back to the beginning."

1043
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,635
What did he mean?

1044
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:08,314
I think he wanted me to come here
where it all started.

1045
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,994
Every time he tries to tell me why,
the virus stops him.

1046
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,674
He can't fight it.
This won't end until he's destroyed.

1047
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,036
But I can't do it. It's all my fault, not his.

1048
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,870
What's the matter with you?

1049
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,599
That's the saddest story I ever heard.

1050
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,994
I'm the one with the problem, not you.

1051
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,429
-Get over it.
-Okay.

1052
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,839
That was fast.

1053
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,036
You know what? We're gonna help you.

1054
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,714
You will? How are you gonna do that?

1055
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,115
My friend, we're DigiDestined.

1056
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:44,189
We'll find the answer together, as a team.

1057
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,874
I've never been on a team.
Anything I should know?

1058
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,349
Yeah, I'm the only one who can kiss Kari.

1059
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,512
-Just a little one?
-Don't even joke around about this, got it?

1060
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,672
-She and I really hit it off in New York.
-I'm not kidding.

1061
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,909
Willis?

1062
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,718
I don't mean to eavesdrop,
but I've got really big ears.

1063
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:04,759
I know you're facing Kokomon tomorrow.
I want to be right there next to you.

1064
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:08,276
I couldn't live with myself
if something were to happen to you.

1065
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,631
This is my mistake and I won't risk
your safety to correct it.

1066
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,836
-He's my brother.
-I don't care!

1067
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,753
Willis, I'm not your pet. I'm your friend.

1068
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:19,718
And friends are always there
for each other.

1069
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,398
Now that's what I'm talking about:
teamwork.

1070
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,439
Thanks, pal.

1071
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:32,993
Okay, let's find Kokomon.

1072
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,638
Don't worry. He'll find us.

1073
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,068
Go back!

1074
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:46,154
I did! I'm here! What else do you want?

1075
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,032
Destroy!

1076
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,711
He has a lot of issues.

1077
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,678
He's digivolving.

1078
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,948
Terriermon, be careful. He's stronger now.

1079
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,076
Terriermon, digivolve to....

1080
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,639
Gargomon!

1081
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,112
Veemon, your turn.

1082
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,318
Show him what you're made of!

1083
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,550
Veemon, armor digivolve to....

1084
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,394
Flamedramon, the Fire of Courage!

1085
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,351
Armadillomon, you too!

1086
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,068
Armadillomon, armor digivolve to....

1087
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,270
Digmon, the Drill of Power!

1088
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,030
Hawkmon, go for it!

1089
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,395
Hawkmon, armor digivolve to....

1090
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,759
Halsemon, the Wings of Love!

1091
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,079
Fire Rocket!

1092
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,033
That's the way!

1093
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:25,912
I'll trip him up. Almost tripped myself.

1094
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,119
Gargo Pellets!

1095
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,991
Don't make me do this.

1096
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:02,635
How do you like your Kokomon,
flame-broiled or grilled?

1097
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,679
Can't we end this quickly?

1098
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,830
After all, I'm on vacation.

1099
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,029
Howdy.

1100
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,510
Aren't our Digimon fantastic?

1101
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,239
Digmon could be a little more animated.

1102
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,513
I guess that's it.

1103
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,396
I don't think he's gone.

1104
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,398
Now what?

1105
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,757
I'm not a duck.

1106
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,117
I need a nap.

1107
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,951
I think I strained something
trying to digivolve.

1108
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,631
We're being sucked in.

1109
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,599
This is my fault.

1110
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,910
Why? Are you the one
who taught him to juggle?

1111
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,831
Put us down, you clown!

1112
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,115
-Leave them alone! Take me instead.
-Okay.

1113
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,639
Watch out!

1114
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:35,518
What do we have to do
to end this fighting?

1115
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,828
Destroy!

1116
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,871
Bunny Blast!

1117
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,558
A little help here.

1118
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,434
Veemon!

1119
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,518
Let me help you up.

1120
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,951
Now let me help you up.

1121
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,873
-Hawkmon, I'll help you.
-No need. I'm--

1122
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,593
Oh, Hawkmon, I'm so glad you're not hurt.

1123
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,512
Yes, I know,
but you don't have to choke me to prove it.

1124
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,635
Armadillomon!

1125
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:12,474
Cody, I've been digging all over for you.

1126
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,639
Vee Head Butt!

1127
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,799
Bunny Blast!

1128
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,359
Bombs away!

1129
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,914
-We got him!
-Think again.

1130
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,151
He's gonna eat us.

1131
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:41,673
Hand of Fate!

1132
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:44,908
Angemon!

1133
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,071
And Angewomon!

1134
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,109
You saved us! Exquisite timing.

1135
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,708
Sorry we're late.

1136
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,756
-Hey, look, T.K.
-Kari!

1137
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,593
We would've been here sooner,
but our plans got derailed.

1138
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,398
Yeah! Kari, you made it!

1139
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,471
Gatomon and Patamon were worried.

1140
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,552
So they digivolved
into Angewomon and Angemon.

1141
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,831
Celestial Arrow!

1142
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,232
Angel Staff!

1143
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:28,837
Either this is an eclipse,
or we're in trouble.

1144
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:32,071
-I'm not supposed to be out after dark.
-It's cold.

1145
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,875
Look, his wounds are healing.

1146
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,473
It's got to be that virus inside of him.

1147
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,918
Poromon, there's nothing you can do.
Stay here.

1148
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,479
Let me go!

1149
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,875
Davis, what's happening to you?

1150
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,436
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size, you big bully?

1151
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,877
Kokomon is making time go backwards.
Everyone's getting younger.

1152
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,757
Davis, you're a baby.

1153
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,554
Who are you calling a baby, you baby?

1154
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,471
I'm a baby, look!

1155
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,911
"Back to the beginning"?

1156
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:18,230
Willis, "Back to the beginning"
didn't mean go back to Colorado.

1157
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:22,233
It means, go back in time to when
the virus first attacked Kokomon.

1158
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,993
-That's it.
-We have to stop him.

1159
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,389
Before you know it,
we'll be changing diapers.

1160
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,277
Let me go!

1161
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,270
I'm sorry but you're grounded.

1162
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,675
We don't have the strength to defeat him.

1163
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,991
The new Digimon will have to use
the power of the golden DigiEggs.

1164
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:45,835
We must digivolve to our Mega
forms to release the golden DigiEggs.

1165
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,070
Angemon, warp digivolve to....

1166
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,429
Seraphymon!

1167
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,394
Angewomon, digivolve to....

1168
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,233
Magnadramon!

1169
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,113
Aren't they beautiful?

1170
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,275
Hurry, here he comes.

1171
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,036
We released the golden DigiEggs.

1172
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,918
Now the others can
golden armor digivolve.

1173
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,351
This is our last shot.

1174
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,393
-What do I do with this?
-Just do exactly what I do.

1175
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,073
You ready?

1176
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,991
Golden armor energize!

1177
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,591
Golden armor energize!

1178
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:47,033
Veemon, golden armor digivolve to....

1179
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,873
Terriermon, golden armor digivolve to....

1180
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,354
Magnamon!

1181
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,394
Rapidmon!

1182
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:00,950
Is that the coolest thing
you've ever seen, or what?

1183
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,433
Rapid Fire!

1184
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,039
Magna Blast!

1185
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,192
-lt didn't work.
-He's too strong.

1186
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:28,119
Every time we attack, he regenerates.
Let's blast him from the inside.

1187
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,031
Good idea. Follow me!

1188
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,670
He ate them. Terriermon!

1189
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,957
Listen to me, Poromon.

1190
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,478
You have to give it time to heal, okay?

1191
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,477
Time to heal.

1192
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,591
What's that up ahead?

1193
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,152
I don't know. Look!

1194
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,792
What's he doing?

1195
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,116
He's trying to tell us something.

1196
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:07,829
-What's he pointing to?
-There must be something inside of him.

1197
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,239
The virus!

1198
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,910
He's trying to show us how to help him.

1199
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,718
What does he want us to do?

1200
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,228
Destroy!

1201
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:18,919
Destroy the virus!

1202
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,315
Right. Time to heal.

1203
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,553
Rapid Fire!

1204
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,359
Magna Blast!

1205
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,348
Kokomon!

1206
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,034
Willis!

1207
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,834
The virus, it's all gone.

1208
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,719
Thank you.

1209
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,190
Now I've lost both of them.

1210
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:06,036
You'll never lose me, Willis.
I told you, I'm your friend.

1211
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,073
Friends are always there for each other.

1212
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:11,873
Terriermon!

1213
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:19,709
I guess without the virus,
Kokomon couldn't heal himself anymore.

1214
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,518
The battle was too much for him.

1215
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,397
Don't be sad, Willis.

1216
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,795
One thing you have to learn
about Digimon, they never really die.

1217
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,830
Thanks for coming back to New York
with me. I'm gonna miss you guys.

1218
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:41,434
-I think we'll see each other again.
-I sure hope so.

1219
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,398
We're getting used to being part of a team.
Right, Terriermon?

1220
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,708
Yeah.

1221
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,597
One last thing. 'Bye.

1222
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,950
Hey, what did I tell you about kissing Kari?

1223
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,519
She's my girl.

1224
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,637
What do you mean "your" girl?

1225
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,631
Nothing, just guy talk.

1226
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:59,629
Hi, Mom, I'm on the island.
I'm waiting for the ferry and I'll be home.

1227
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,359
Yeah, I had a lot of fun. It was a great trip.

1228
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,078
I met a lot of new friends.

1229
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:06,594
I had a couple of fights,
but I'll tell you later.

1230
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:08,079
Yeah, I miss you, too.

1231
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,754
Does anyone besides me smell a DigiEgg?

1232
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,792
Kokomon!

1233
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:25,350
Like I said, Willis learned
about teamwork the hard way.

1234
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,237
He also found out that Davis was right.

1235
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:31,279
Digimon never really die.
Their information just gets reconfigured.

1236
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,875
Only sometimes they come back
singing a different tune.

1237
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,353
He's tone-deaf.
